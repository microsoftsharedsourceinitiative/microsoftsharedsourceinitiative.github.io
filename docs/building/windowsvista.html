<p>this might be the layout of the Windows Vista NTTREE Found in the Vista WDK Makefile.plt</p>

<ul>
<li>To build the 'Simple' project in the 'Begin' Directory open an Windows Vista SDK CMD Prompt and type:</li>

<pre>nmake</pre> 

</ul>

<p>In the WinDDK Windows Vista root make a PUBLIC folder with a SDK and DDK Directory in them and copy the SDK and DDK too thehose directories and use setenv.bat to set the environment open it with notepad and view the useage at the bottom of the batch file./p>

<p>You might want to install the Longhorn Driver Kit or LDK and SDK the Samples from the SDK or in the PDC 2003 Whideby DVD and the SDK Help. Here is a link to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/pdc-2003-conference-dvds-presentation-and-longhorn-discs">2003 PDC</a>and <a href="https://archive.org/details/vsenard1">PDC 2003 Whideby DVD</a></p>

<p>To build samples in the Windows Vista SDK and WDK which is subscription only you just need the WDK Vista CMD Prompt and nmake. Again read the makefile.plt file for a NT Operating System directory layout. Start with a PUBLIC directory and a sdk and ddk directory within that. Maybe start the XP/2003 Research Kernel. I'll look for Vista Acedemic papers at Microsoft Research.</p>

<h3>Acedemic Papers</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742287607000503">Here is a VAD Tree acedemic paper</a></p>

<p>You can read about the Windows API Code Pack from the Code Project <a target="_self" href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/109403/Windows-API-Code-Pack-v-Released" data-test-app-aware-link="">here</a> Please refactor with Visual Studio 2017, 2019 on 10 or 2005 in the XP VM, the namespace 'Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack' to 'Microsoft.Windows'</p>

<p>Set up a Lab03_N a buffer lab with a "N' NOT A FINAL LAB or a Longhorn build number in private with the Longhorn LDK and SDK, .NET Framework 2.1 and start making NT Projects in private. I'm at Microsoft research downloading systems papers And it wont be a Final lab until. Try and code your own Longhorn Beta with the Longhorn Migration guite may help as well as the PDC 2003 Discs there are 5 or 6.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/main/Samples/Win7Samples">Windows Vista/7 Samples</a></h3>
 
<p>In further posts we will get into the login screen and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/gina">GINA</a></p>

<p>Install Longhorn in a Virtual Machine and mount the VHD in XP to dismantle the evaluation time bomb.</p>
<p>The First Sample well go over is the Login Screen Sample in the Longhorn SDK</p>

<p>Install the 2008 SDK and WDK copy the 6.1 and sdk files to a Lab08_n and take note the the Vista samples directory is really your 'NT' directory. Install Visual Studio 2008 Team Suite  and the Phoniex 2008 SDK 
that contains the LISP Kit and the new C++ Pascal compiler source. The Vista Source Tree file structure is in the DDK Bin Makefile.plt file. and compare both sdk and wdk with directories with windiff and carefully go through the samples and src directories and compare and recreate Lab03 save both setenv.bat files and name the apporiate files setenv.sdk and setenv.ddk.After your done and you set the ddk environment. You can set up the VS Directory with SharpDevelop, The Common Compiler Infustructure, Dafney, .NET Framework 3.0 Reference Source,Symbols Windows API Code Pack, The Visual Studio Project System and Spec#.</p>
