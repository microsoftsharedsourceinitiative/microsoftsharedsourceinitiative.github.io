<p>I'm still reading all on the XP/2003 Batch files for all the shares and source depot views.</p>
<p>The Original Code Center Priemium Site had a Site had a Source Directory. Put your Windows SDK's, DDK's, OPK's, AIK's in eack coresponding version from Windows 1.0 to 2022.

<p>The Offical Build Number of the XP/2003 leak or SSILP if the truth be known; source is 5.1.2600.6000.240228-0756 is revision 6000 the same as the 2009 Embedded RTM.</p>

<p>This revision does not come with sdinit.cmd the source depot initalization script, so therefore source depot might not be fuctional. You may read razzle.cmd for further details.</p>

<h2>Setting up the folder shares</h2>
<p>depot,fxdev,retail,vsbuilt,symbols,vs,debug,xpclient,sdkdrop</p>
<h2>Setting up VSBUILT</h2>

<p>In the root of %NTROOT% make a 'vsbuilt' directory and copy every VC or Visual C/C++ Tools directory to 'VSBuilt' with the coresponding 'PlatformSDK' in the same ex. 'Vc7' directory for each version of Visual C/C++ 4.0-2008
You may search the revision for a directory called 'crts' and use windiff or sdkdiff and put together a nice C Runtime from the revision. Compare it to the 2003 VC++ RTM In the 'crts' directory you can study algorithms like heap sort and standard input and output. The revision is just a build, the 2003 VC++ CRT RTM is more recent and the 2002 VC++ RTM is too old. All of the files are in the build you just have to put together a SDK, DDK, Ifskit, and VC drop.
The 'lib' files are in the 'NT' public sdk and ddk directories.</p>

<p>Make a 'ntbld' virual directory for the NT directory, in Internet Information Services or IIS with is a 80's freeware project for virual browsing and source depot.</p>

<p>You might be missing four $ files the 'checkclr.c', 'nochkclr.c' and 2 printer files. You might want to hook up your professors printer on UNIX/LINUX per Donald Knuth. These files are only in the RTM Gold Visual Studio master. There should be no copying from the RTM files only copy to 'VSBuilt' from the NT Directory or revsion. and maybe make a Vc7b directory. If you have betas of Visual Studio 2002 make a beta drop, just be careful not to make incomaptable versions.</p>

<p>sdkdiff is in the Begin directory of the Platform SDK Samples and windiff is in SDKTools use build utility to built windiff and the vsvar32.bat to set the VC Tools and use namke to build sdkdiff and your off and running. Vc7 (2002 Platform SDK) Vc8 (2005 Platform SDK).</p>

<p>The point being the Samples are a good spring board on learning Windows Technologies to Build Windows in your career.</p> 

<ul>
<li>Change the 127.0.0.1 localhost to 127.0.0.1 sourcedepot the the machines host file.</li>
<li>You might want to try and use Perl ISAPI to configure the Source Depot Documentation in the tools/x86/perl directory.</li>
<li>In the enlistment directory there are source depot templates sd.ini.txt and sdclient.ini.txt. Rename appropriately and place them in the /tools directory.</li>
<li>Copy intlview.map from the tools directory and rename it SD.MAP and place it in the NT Root or %SDXROOT%</li>
</ul> 
<pre>set sdxroot=D:\NT</pre>
<pre>You can try to run sdx.cmd</pre>
<pre>Rename 'projects.map' in the tools directory to 'sd.map' and place in the root of the NT directory.</pre>
<pre>enlist projects ex: sdx enlist NT main com -c</pre>
<pre>tools\ntnewver.cmd</pre>
<ul>
<li>Start in the NT\sdktools\vs\enlistment directory. Read the envvs.cmd file and make a Visual Studio Drop. From the %SDXROOT%\public directory. And Visual Studio 2002 or 2003 VC7</li>
<li>Start in the debuggers directory after you leave the enlistment directory there are source depot templates.</li>
</ul>

<pre>run envvs.cmd The default background is green.</pre>

<p>You can compile the Lab 01 down to about 8 errors the rest of the Labs and Operating System shouldn't have any errors. You should have the research kernel to muck around with also from college, 
	needing to comment out the Longhorn additions in revision 6000, files beginning with 'dp' are Longhorn files. The 'dp' files are not in the 'Longhorn' beta LDK they maybe in a IDW or internal developer workstation release if I can find one. 
	Maybe look in Embedded 2009 for supported hardware and maybe learning what PCI hardware and coding the plug n' play to support in the NT Kernel. 
	The PCI codes you can use now a days in 2024 is Linux and you might want to remove some of the cheap hardware.</p>

<h2>Lab01: Base Services</h2>
<pre>Copy the base\ntos directory and all of it's files to Lab01 it might be a virtual lab in source depot and it is a physical lab.</pre>
<pre>CD to base\busdrv\isapnp and use the message compiler to generate 'message.h'</pre>
<pre>Make pcicodes.h using the message compiler too. This file goes in base\busdrv\pci</pre>
<pre>build -cz </pre> 
<pre>delobj.cmd to clean the source tree</pre>	

<h2>Lab02: Networking</h2>
<p>For OS/2-based servers, the Net functions supported by Microsoft LAN Manager provided much of the functionality required for a network operating system; this functionality was missing from the local operating system. Windows NT, Windows 95, and Windows 98 have much of this network functionality built in. Therefore, some of the original Net functions are no longer supported. </p>

<p>Windows NT, Windows 95, and Windows 98 support a variety of networking functions. The set of Net functions provide additional capability not covered by other networking functions. In addition, you may use these functions to monitor and administer OS/2-based LAN Manager servers</p>

	<pre>Copy the NT\net directory to Lab02. The Network Stack or Lab will build without error in the Vitrual Lab. 
     You might have issues in the Pysical Lab</pre>		
	<pre>build -cz</pre>
	<pre>delobj.cmd to clean the source tree</pre>	
<h2>Lab03: <a href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Build_lab#cite_note-3" data-test-app-aware-link="">Server</a></h2>
	<pre>Copy the Entire Server folder from nt5src.7z to Lab03</pre>
	<pre>The entire Server build should build with about 20 shipping errors and take about 6 hrs for a free build and 12 hrs for a checked.</pre>
	<pre>build -cz</pre>
	<pre>delobj.cmd to clean the source tree</pre>
<h2>Lab04: <a href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Build_lab#cite_note-4">Terminal Services</a></h2>
	<pre>Copy NT\termsrv directory to Lab04. The Terminal Services Stack should build without error in the Virtual Lab.
	     You might have issues in the Physical Lab.
	</pre>
	<pre>build -cz</pre>
	<pre>delobj.cmd to clean the source tree</pre>

<h2>Lab05: The Component Object Model Stack Including the Common Language Infustructure</h2>
<p>The Component Object Model
The Component Object Model (COM) is a platform-independent, distributed, object-oriented, system for creating binary software components that can interact. COM is the foundation technology for Microsoft's OLE (compound documents), ActiveX (internet enabled components), as well as others.</p>

<p>To understand COM (and therefore all COM-based technologies), it is crucial to bear in mind that it is not an object-oriented language, but a standard. Nor does COM specify how an application should be structured. Language, structure, and implementation details are left to the application programmer. COM does specify an object model and programming requirements that enable COM objects (also called COM components, or sometimes simply objects) to interact with other objects. These objects can be within a single process, in other processes, even on remote machines. They can have been written in other languages, and may be structurally quite dissimilar. That is why COM is referred to as a binary standard - it is a standard that applies after a program has been translated to binary machine code.</p>

<p>The only language requirement for COM is that code is generated in a language that can create structures of pointers and, either explicitly or implicitly, call functions through pointers. Object-oriented languages such as C++ and Smalltalk provide programming mechanisms that simplify the implementation of COM objects, but languages such as C, Pascal, Ada, Java, and even BASIC programming environments can create and use COM objects. </p>

<p>COM defines the essential nature of a COM object. In general, a software object is made up of a set of data and the functions that manipulate the data. A COM object is one in which access to an object's data is achieved exclusively through one or more sets of related functions. These function sets are called interfaces, and the functions of an interface are called methods. Further, COM requires that the only way to gain access to the methods of an interface is through a pointer to the interface. </p>

<p>Besides specifying the basic binary object standard, COM defines certain basic interfaces that provide functions common to all COM-based technologies. It also provides a small number of API functions that all components require. COM has now expanded its scope to define how objects work together over a distributed environment, and added security features to ensure system and component integrity.</p>

<pre>However the Beta Wiki doesn't list a Lab 05 I believe it's either the SSCLI or the COM Stack. With the .NET Framework.</pre>
	<pre>To build the SSCLI you need Visual Studio 2005 Professional or higher in a 2000 or 2003 Virtual Machine. And Active State 
	Perl ActivePerl-5.16.3.1603-MSWin32-x86-296746.msi or ActivePerl-5.16.3.1603-MSWin32-x64-296746.msi for 64-Bit
	</pre>
	<pre>extract the sscli20_20060311.tgz for 2.0 or 1.0 sscli_20021101.tgz sscli_ref_20021101.tgz and and Gyro Genetrics with 1.0 
	and execute env.bat at the root of the directory. To set the free or checked environment then execute buildall.cmd.</pre>
	<pre>To build the COM stack run build -cz in the root of the COM directory or lab.</pre>


<h2>Lab06: User interface</h2>
<pre>Copy NT\shell directory to Lab06. The UI Stack should build without error in the Virtual Lab.
	 You might have issues in the Physical Lab. With the GNUmakfile
</pre>
<pre>build -cz</pre>
<pre>delobj.cmd to clean the source tree</pre>

<h2>Lab07: Internet Information Services/COM+</h2>:  
<pre>Copy NT\inetsrv directory to Lab07. The IIS Stack should build without error in the Virtual Lab.
		You might have issues in the Physical Lab.
	</pre>
	<pre>build -cz</pre>
	<pre>delobj.cmd to clean the source tree</pre>
<p>build individual projects</p>
<pre>in the directory of a makefile with build -cz</pre>
<p> or </p>
<p> build the whole operating system </p>
<pre>perl tools\timebuild.pl -NOCLEANBUILD -NOSYNC -NOSCORCH </pre>
If you want to wait 6 to 12 hours for a new clean build you'll type this:
<pre>perl tools\timebuild.pl -!NOCLEANBUILD -NOSYNC -NOSCORCH  -NOPOSTBUILD</pre>
<pre>build -cz</pre>
<p>POSTBUILD:</p>

<p>After the build the Active Directory Migration Tools and Debugging Tools should be built. After the post build very edition and every supported language should be built. In the binaries directory the usa   default build should be revision 6000 leading up to Windows Embedded 2009. After the Windows 6000 revision source build you might want to use the SLD files in the 'mantis' folder with XP embedded and make a Embedded Windows repository and engineer 2003 revision 6000 which was released in Embedded 2009. You can compile the Operating System down to about 16 errors needing to remove the Longhorn additions in revision 6000 maybe look in Embedded 2009 for supported hardware and maybe learning what PCI hardware and coding the plug n' play to support in the NT Kernel. The PCI codes you can use now a days in 2024 is Linux and you might want to remove some of the cheap hardware.</p>

<h2><a href="la/published/Runtime image.pdf">Building a Windows XP Embedded Runtime Image</a></h2>

<p>To build MSMQ in NT->inetserv->MSMQ install Visual C++ 6.0 with MSDN Library put the Build Utlity from NT->tools->x86 in the exacutables PATH in the Options tab in Visual C++ 6.0 and set NTMAKEENV in the Control Panel to the 2003 DDK Bin. The Workspace is a Visual C++ 6.0 workspace. From the CMD Prompt run 'scortch.cmd' to set %FROOT%. Please make sure the SDXROOT is set. This Workspace has more environment varables to set and Microsoft used MINGW in the building of XP not PTC. Download GetGNUWin32-Legacy-Install from Sourceforge.<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/OldFiles/">here</a> to build MINGW 1.0 for source.</p>

<p>The Boot Process for XP/2003 is:</p>
<p>Use Bootsect to write MBR and boot sector.</p>
<pre>bootsect /nt52. e:</pre>
<p>NTLDR, Ntdetect.com, Ntbootdd.sys, Ntoskrnl.exe, hal.dll, smss.exe, winlogon.exe, Service Contol Manager SCM</p>
<p>In a free build the kernel may not build you may have to to use the Windows Research Kernel. Microsoft does not give you the source to WinLogon even in the SSLIP. It's named Winlogon.exe.lc</p>

<p>A build lab (or simply a <strong>lab</strong>) commonly refers to a <a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" data-test-app-aware-link="">Microsoft Windows</a> source code branch. By extension, it can also refer to the team that works on this branch. </p>
<p> Microsoft has used multiple prefixes to refer to feature branches over time:</p>
  
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/microsoft-public-symbols">Setting up a Public Symbol Server</a></p>

<pre>You can use the Symchk tool to check to see if the Symbol file is public or private.</pre>

<p>To get WMI support, you need at least the XP SP2 OPK CD. It has updated tools to build the source for WinPE.

If you have this OPK CD, just add /WMI to the MKIMG command.</p>

<p>To start migrating to Longhorn you need the 'Avalon' and 'Indigo' Tech Preview</p>
