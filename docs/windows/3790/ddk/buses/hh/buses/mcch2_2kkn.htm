<P>In order to use PCI interrupts instead of ISA interrupts, 16-bit PC Cards must meet the following two basic requirements.

<UL>
	<LI><B>Support for PCI level-triggered interrupt generation.</B> Most 16-bit PC Cards comply with this requirement, because the PCMCIA standard specifies that PCMCIA cards must support level-triggered interrupts. </LI>

	<LI><B>Support for interrupt sharing.</B> Many 16-bit PC Cards do not comply with this requirement. PCI interrupts are shareable, so the system cannot assign a PCI interrupt number to a 16-bit PC Card if the card does not support shareable interrupts. Common reasons why a 16-bit PC Card cannot share interrupts include:
<UL>
	<LI><B>Failure of the interrupt service routine (ISR) to return the number of the interrupt.</B> On a PCI bus, an ISR must indicate which interrupt it is servicing by returning the number of the interrupt after it completes. ISRs for some 16-bit PC Cards do not do this. </LI>

	<LI><B>Failure of the PC Card to indicate the interrupts it asserts in its hardware registers.</B> A PC Card must indicate the number of the interrupt it is asserting in its hardware registers to avoid contention for the same interrupt number with other devices. Some 16-bit PC Cards do not do this.</LI>

	<LI><B>Generation of spurious interrupts when powering up.</B> PC Cards must not generate any interrupts other than those that are assigned to them by the system. Some 16-bit PC Cards generate spurious interrupts when powering up, before the system has assigned them interrupts. </LI>
</UL>

<P>A PC Card that does not fulfill these requirements can cause an interrupt storm that provokes a system crash.
</LI>
