<P>Vendors and developers should observe the following cautions in order to avoid problems related with interrupt sharing:

<UL>
	<LI>Driver developers should design drivers to support shareable PCI interrupts.</LI>

	<LI>PC Card manufacturers should manufacture CardBus cards instead of 16-bit PC Cards, because they are PCI compliant.</LI>

	<LI>All 16-bit PC Cards should support shareable PCI interrupts.</LI>

	<LI>All 16-bit PC Cards should support the flexible allocation of I/O resources for devices that connect to them. In particular, cards should not request specific ranges of I/O space. Instead, they should request the amount of I/O space they require and allow the system to allocate the addresses flexibly.</LI>

	<LI>Computer manufacturers should be aware that there are devices that require ISA IRQs, and should ensure that ISA IRQs are available to CardBus controllers in the system.</LI>

	<LI>Computer manufacturers should ensure that the BIOS code sets CardBus controllers to PCIC mode. </LI>
</UL>
