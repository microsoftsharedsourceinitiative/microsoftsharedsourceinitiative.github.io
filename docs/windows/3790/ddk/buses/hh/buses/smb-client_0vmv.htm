<P>A <I>System Management Bus</I> (SMB) is a simple bus used primarily to communicate with devices on the motherboard, such as the battery subsystem, temperature sensor, lid switch, or other low-bandwidth devices. The SMB is generally not user configurable or accessible. Support for SMB devices is provided on Windows&nbsp;2000 and later operating systems. Windows 98/Me does not support such devices.</P>

<P>An <I>SMB client driver</I> provides device-specific capabilities for an SMB device. An SMB client communicates with the SMB class driver (<I>smbclass.sys</I>) and the class driver for its device type, if such a driver exists. The following figure shows the drivers involved in controlling an SMB device.</P>

<P><B>SMB Drivers</B></P>

<P>As the previous figure shows, the following drivers (reading from the bottom up) are involved in controlling a device on the System Management Bus:

<UL>
	<LI>The <I>SMB class driver</I>, which communicates with the bus, the client driver, and the SMB host controller. The class driver, which is supplied by Microsoft, provides services common to all SMB devices. </LI>

	<LI>The <I>SMB host controller driver</I>, essentially a miniclass driver that works with the SMB class driver. The SMB class driver and host controller together communicate with the device through the bus. The host controller driver is also supplied by Microsoft.</LI>

	<LI>The <I>SMB client driver</I>, which sends IRPs to the SMB class driver to request operations on the device. The client driver acts as the Plug-and-Play (PnP) function driver for the SMB device. If a class driver is present for the device class, the client driver and the device class driver together handle device operations and act as the <I>function driver</I>.
<P>For example, the system-supplied smart battery driver is an SMB client as well as a battery miniclass driver; as such, it combines the functions of the SMB client and the battery miniclass driver. Together with the battery class driver, it acts as the PnP function driver for the smart battery subsystem on the SMB.
</LI>

	<LI>The device class driver for the device (optional). If a device class driver is not present, then any upper level filter drivers communicate directly with the SMB client driver.</LI>

	<LI>Upper-level filter drivers (optional).</LI>
