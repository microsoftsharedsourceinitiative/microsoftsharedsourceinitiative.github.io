<DL>
<DT><B>NoDeviceConnected</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates that there is no device connected to the port. </DD>

<DT><B>DeviceConnected</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates that a device was successfully connected to the port.  </DD>

<DT><B>DeviceFailedEnumeration</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port, but the enumeration of the device failed.  </DD>

<DT><B>DeviceGeneralFailure</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port, but the connection failed for unspecified reasons.   </DD>

<DT><B>DeviceCausedOvercurrent</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port, but the attempt failed because of an overcurrent condition. </DD>

<DT><B>DeviceNotEnoughPower</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port, but there was not enough power to drive the device, and the connection failed. </DD>

<DT><B>DeviceNotEnoughBandwidth</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port, but there was not enough bandwidth available for the device to function properly, and the connection failed. </DD>

<DT><B>DeviceHubNestedTooDeeply</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port, but the nesting of USB hubs was too deep, so the connection failed. </DD>

<DT><B>DeviceInLegacyHub</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port of an unsupported legacy hub, and the connection failed.
