<H4>Operation</H4>

<P>The IOCTL_SERIAL_LSRMST_INSERT request enables or disables the insertion of information about line status and modem status in the receive data stream. If LSRMST insertion is enabled, the driver inserts event information for the supported event types. The event information includes an <I>event header</I> followed by event-specific data. The event header contains a client-specified escape character and a flag that identifies the event. The driver supports the following event types:

<DL>
<DT>SERIAL_LSRMST_LSR_DATA</DT>

<DD>A change occurred in the line status. Serial inserts an event header followed by the event-specific data, which is the value of the line status register followed by the character present in the receive hardware when the line-status change was processed. </DD>

<DT>SERIAL_LSRMST_LSR_NODATA</DT>

<DD>A line status change occurred, but no data was available in the receive buffer. Serial inserts an event header followed by the event-specific data, which is the value of the line status register when the line status change was processed. </DD>

<DT>SERIAL_LSRMST_MST</DT>

<DD>A change occurred in the modem status. Serial inserts an event header followed by the event-specific data, which is the value of the modem status register when the modem-status change was processed. </DD>

<DT>SERIAL_LSRMST_ESCAPE</DT>

<DD>Indicates that the next character in the receive data stream, which was received from the device, is identical to the client-specified escape character. Serial inserts an event header. There is no event-specific data.
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Input</H4>

<P>The <B>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</B> member points to a client-allocated UCHAR that is used to input an escape character. If the escape character is non-NULL, insertion is enabled, and the serial driver uses the specified escape character. Otherwise, insertion is disabled.</P>

<P>The <B>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</B> is set to the size in bytes of an UCHAR.</P>

<H4>Output</H4>

<P>None.</P>

<H4>I/O Status Block</H4>

<P>If the request is successful, the <B>Information</B> member is set to the size in bytes of a UCHAR. Otherwise, <B>Information</B> is set to zero.</P>

<P>The <B>Status</B> member is set to one of the <A HREF="serref_61bm.htm#ddk_generic_status_values_for_serial_device_control_requests_kr">Generic Status Values for Serial Device Control Requests</A>. A status of STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER indicates that the specified escape character is the same as the XON or the XOFF character, or that error replacement is enabled with handshake flow control.</P>

<H4>Headers</H4>

<P>Defined in <I>ntddser.h</I>. Include <I>ntddser.h</I>.</P>
