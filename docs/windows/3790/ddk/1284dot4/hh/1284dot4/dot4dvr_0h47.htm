<P>A client can use <I>Dot4 activity broadcasting</I> to be notified after certain events, or activities, occur on a <A HREF="dot4dvr_3wvb.htm">Dot4 channel</A>.</P>

<P>A client can add activity broadcasting when a <A HREF="dot4dvr_3wvb.htm">Dot4 channel</A> is opened or by using an <A HREF="dot4ref_9p9u.htm">IOCTL_DOT4_ADD_ACTIVITY_BROADCAST</A> request. If activity broadcasting is active on a channel, the Dot4 driver queues activities on an<I> </I>activity queue in the order in which they occur. An activity is represented by a <A HREF="dot4ref_8zaq.htm">DOT4_ACTIVITY</A> structure.</P>

<P>A client registers to be notified if an activity occurs by using an <A HREF="dot4ref_08mq.htm">IOCTL_DOT4_WAIT_ACTIVITY_BROADCAST</A> request. The Dot4 driver completes the wait request if an activity exists on the activity queue. If there are no queued activities when the Dot4 driver processes the wait request, it sets the status of the request to STATUS_PENDING, and queues the wait request.</P>

<P>After a client adds activity broadcasting, it should immediately use an <A HREF="dot4ref_08mq.htm">IOCTL_DOT4_WAIT_ACTIVITY_BROADCAST</A> request. If activities are not removed at the same rate as they are added to the queue, the activity queue will expand indefinitely.</P>

<P>A client removes activity broadcasting by using an <A HREF="dot4ref_348i.htm">IOCTL_DOT4_REMOVE_ACTIVITY_BROADCAST</A> request. The Dot4 driver deletes all activities on the activity queue, and completes all pending wait requests.  </P>
