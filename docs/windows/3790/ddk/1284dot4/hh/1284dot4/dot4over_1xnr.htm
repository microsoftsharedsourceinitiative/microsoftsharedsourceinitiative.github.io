<P>Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;2000 and later includes the following driver support for Dot4 devices:

<UL>
	<LI>The <A HREF="dot4dvr_0kkn.htm">Dot4 driver</A> is the function driver and bus driver for the <A HREF="dot4over_4qp3.htm">Dot4 device setup class</A>. The Dot4 driver enumerates and controls access to all its child devices, or <A HREF="dot4dvr_121z.htm">Dot4 functions</A>. The executable image of the Dot4 driver is <I>dot4.sys</I>.</LI>

	<LI>The system-supplied bus driver for parallel ports is the parent bus driver for Dot4 devices that are attached to a parallel port. This bus driver supports the <A HREF="dot4dvr_0alj.htm">Dot4 data link</A> that the Dot4 driver requires to access a Dot4 device. For more information about the parallel port bus driver, see <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">System-Supplied Parallel Drivers</A>.</LI>

	<LI>The <I>Dot4prt driver</I> is the function and bus driver for the <A HREF="dot4over_4j3b.htm">Dot4Print device setup class</A>. The Dot4prt driver provides a connection layer between existing system printer components and Dot4 print functions. The Dot4prt driver creates a functional device object (FDO) for a Dot4Print device and a physical device object (PDO) for a single-child device, which is a member of the Printer device setup class. Upper-level system printer components and drivers access and operate Printer devices. The executable image of the Dot4prt driver is <I>dot4prt.sys</I>.</LI>

	<LI>The <I>Dot4scan driver</I> is the function driver for <A HREF="dot4over_3nzb.htm">Dot4 scanner functions</A>, which are Dot4 functions that implement a scanner. The Dot4scan driver provides a connection layer between existing system imaging components and Dot4 scanner functions. A Dot4 scanner function is a member of the Image device setup class, and is operated through the services of the WIA drivers. The executable image of the Dot4scan driver is <I>dot4scan.sys</I>.</LI>
