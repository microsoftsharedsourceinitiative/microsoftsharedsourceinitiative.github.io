<H2><A NAME="ddk_dot4_session_kg"></A>Dot4 Session</H2>

<P>To operate a Dot4 device, a client starts a <I>Dot4 session</I> (or joins a running session), and then uses a sequence of device control requests that specify <A HREF="dot4ref_04s2.htm">Dot4 Function I/O control codes</A> — see <A HREF="#ddk_dot4_session_kg">Dot4 Session</A>.</P>

<P>A Dot4 session is the set of Dot4 driver operations on a Dot4 device during a continuous period of time in which at least one <A HREF="dot4dvr_121z.htm">Dot4 function</A>, opened with write access, remains open. If a Dot4 session is not running, the Dot4 driver starts a session after it receives the first create request that specifies write access for a Dot4 function. The Dot4 driver ends a session after either all Dot4 functions, opened with write access, are closed, or a fatal error occurs when attempting to communicate with a Dot4 device. If a fatal communication error occurs, the Dot4 driver's error handling ends the session, and completes I/O requests with status STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL until the Dot4 driver resets device communication. The Dot4 driver resets device communication after clients close all Dot4 functions opened with write access. After the Dot4 driver resets device communication, a client can try to start a new session.</P>

<P>Before a client starts a Dot4 session, it can dynamically set <A HREF="dot4dvr_79gn.htm">Dot4 flow control policy</A> and <A HREF="dot4dvr_6l9j.htm">Dot4 timeouts</A> for the Dot4 session.</P>

<P>A Dot4 session is based on the concept of an IEEE 1284.4 conversation between two IEEE 1284.4 peers. Only the Dot4 driver can initiate a Dot4 session. During a Dot4 session (and associated IEEE 1284.4 conversation), the host system is the IEEE 1284.4 primary device, and the peripheral device is an IEEE 1284.4 secondary device.</P>



<H4><A NAME="ddk_example_of_a_dot4_session_kg"></A>Example of a Dot4 Session</H4>

<P>A client uses the following sequence of I/O requests to start (or join) a Dot4 session, access a Dot4 service, and end (or leave) a Dot4 session:

<UL>
	<LI>An IRP_MJ_CREATE request (specifying write access) opens the Dot4 function that supports a Dot4 service.
<P>If a Dot4 session is not running when the Dot4 driver receives the create request, the Dot4 driver starts a Dot4 session.
</LI>

	<LI>An IOCTL_DOT4_CREATE_SOCKET request creates a <A HREF="dot4dvr_41t3.htm">Dot4 Socket</A> (an IEEE 1284.4 primary socket) for the Dot4 service supported by the Dot4 function.</LI>

	<LI>An IOCTL_DOT4_OPEN_CHANNEL request opens a <A HREF="dot4dvr_3wvb.htm">Dot4 channel</A> for the Dot4 service. Alternatively, the client can use an IOCTL_DOT4_WAIT_FOR_CHANNEL request to wait for the Dot4 function to open a channel for the service.</LI>

	<LI>A sequence of IOCTL_DOT4_WRITE and IOCTL_DOT4_READ requests write and read data over the service channel.</LI>

	<LI>An IOCTL_DOT4_CLOSE_CHANNEL request closes a service channel.</LI>

	<LI>An IOCTL_DOT4_DESTROY_SOCKET request deletes the socket created for the service.</LI>

	<LI>An IRP_MJ_CLOSE request closes the Dot4 function.
<P>If no Dot4 functions, opened with write access, remain open after the Dot4 driver closes the Dot4 function, the Dot4 driver ends the Dot4 session.
</LI>
</UL>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A client can also use <A HREF="dot4dvr_0h47.htm">Dot4 activity broadcasting</A> during a Dot4 session to be notified about activities that dynamically occur on a Dot4 channel.</P>
