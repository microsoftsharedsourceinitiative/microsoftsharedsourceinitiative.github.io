<P>A PnP bus driver has an <I>AddDevice</I> routine, but it is called when the bus driver is acting as the function driver for its controller or adapter. For example, the PnP Manager calls the USB Hub bus driver's <I>AddDevice</I> routine to add the hub device. The hub driver's <I>AddDevice</I> routine is not called for a child of the hub (a device that plugs into the hub).</P>
