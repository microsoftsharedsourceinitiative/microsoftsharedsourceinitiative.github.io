<P>Because ISRs must execute as quickly as possible, drivers must usually postpone the completion of servicing an interrupt until after the ISR returns. Therefore, the system provides support for <I>deferred procedure calls</I> (DPCs), which can be queued from ISRs and which are executed at a later time and a lower IRQL than the ISR.</P>

<P>Each DPC is associated with a system-defined <I>DPC object</I>. The system supplies one DPC object for each device object. The system initializes this DPC object when a driver registers a DPC routine known as the <A HREF="drvrrtns_9ycy.htm"><I>DpcForIsr</I></A> routine. A driver can create additional DPC objects if more than one DPC is needed. These extra DPCs are known as <A HREF="drvrrtns_3tbm.htm"><I>CustomDPC</I></A> routines.</P>

<P>DPC object contents should not be directly referenced by drivers. The object's structure is not documented. Drivers do not have access to the system-supplied DPC object assigned to each device object. Drivers allocate storage for extra DPCs, but the contents of these DPC objects should only be referenced by system routines. </P>

<P>DPC objects and DPCs can also be used with timers. For more information, see <A HREF="synchro_75pj.htm">Timer Objects and DPCs</A>.</P>
