<P>To use packet-based DMA, drivers of bus-master DMA devices call the following general sequence of support routines as they process an IRP requesting a DMA transfer:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="k105_6asy.htm"><B>KeFlushIoBuffers</B></A> just before attempting to allocate map registers for a transfer request (for more information, see <A HREF="iputoput_7pgn.htm">Maintaining Cache Coherency</A>)</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="kdma_92r6.htm"><B>AllocateAdapterChannel</B></A> when the driver is ready to program the bus-master adapter for DMA</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="k106_5nhu.htm"><B>MmGetMdlVirtualAddress</B></A> to get an index into the MDL, required as an initial parameter to <A HREF="kdma_1hv6.htm"><B>MapTransfer</B></A>, and <B>MapTransfer</B> to make the system physical memory that backs the IRP's buffer device-accessible
<P>Note that any driver might need to carry out more than one transfer operation in order to satisfy the current IRP, as explained in <A HREF="iputoput_70h3.htm">Splitting Transfer Requests</A>. Drivers of devices that do not have scatter/gather capabilities can call <B>MapTransfer</B> once per transfer operation. Drivers of devices that have scatter/gather capabilities can call <B>MapTransfer</B> more than once to set up each transfer operation. Alternatively, these drivers can use the system's built-in scatter/gather support, described in <A HREF="iputoput_7nhj.htm">Using Scatter/Gather DMA</A>.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="kdma_9cxe.htm"><B>FlushAdapterBuffers</B></A> at the end of each DMA transfer operation to/from the target device, in order to determine whether all the requested data has been completely transferred</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="kdma_5rqq.htm"><B>FreeMapRegisters</B></A> as soon as all DMA operations for the current IRP are done, because all the requested data has been completely transferred or because the driver must fail the IRP due to a device or bus I/O error</LI>
</UL>

<P>The adapter object pointer returned by <A HREF="k104_93g2.htm"><B>IoGetDmaAdapter</B></A> is a required parameter to <B>AllocateAdapterChannel</B>, <B>MapTransfer</B>, <B>FlushAdapterBuffers</B>, and <B>FreeMapRegisters</B>. Note that in versions of Windows NT prior to Windows 2000, bus-master devices could pass a NULL adapter object pointer to <B>MapTransfer</B> and<B> FlushAdapterBuffers</B>. In Windows&nbsp;2000 and later, drivers can no longer do so.</P>

<P><B>KeFlushIoBuffers</B> and <B>MmGetMdlVirtualAddress</B> require a pointer to the MDL at<B> Irp-&gt;MdlAddress</B>.</P>

<P>Individual drivers call this sequence of support routines at different points, depending on how each driver is implemented to service its device. For example, one driver's <A HREF="drvrrtns_6isy.htm"><I>StartIo</I></A> routine might make the call to <B>AllocateAdapterChannel</B>, while another driver might make this call from a routine that removes IRPs from a driver-created interlocked queue or device queue.</P>

<P>Instead of using the routines described in this section, any driver that uses packet-based DMA can use support routines intended to streamline scatter/gather DMA, whether or not its device has built-in scatter/gather support. See <A HREF="iputoput_7nhj.htm">Using Scatter/Gather DMA</A> for details.</P>
