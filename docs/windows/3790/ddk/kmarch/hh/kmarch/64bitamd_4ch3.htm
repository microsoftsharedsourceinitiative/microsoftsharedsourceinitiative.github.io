<P>The 64-bit C run-time library contained in the compiler for AMD64 has a number of differences from the 32-bit C run-time libraries contained in the compilers that were shipped with earlier versions of the DDK. The following operations, for example, behave differently between the 64-bit and 32-bit C run-time libraries:

<UL>
	<LI>The conditions under which math exceptions are raised using the <B>_matherr</B> function. For instance, the 32-bit C run-time always generates a domain exception when passed a quiet (unknown or uninitialized) NaN. NaN stands for "not a number," which means a symbolic entity that represents a value not otherwise available in floating-point format. The 64-bit C run time, in general, does not. </LI>

	<LI>The <B>errno</B> values that are set during errors might differ between the 64-bit and 32-bit versions of the library.</LI>
</UL>
