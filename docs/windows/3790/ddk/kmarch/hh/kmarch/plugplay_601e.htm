	<LI>The PnP Manager fails create requests for the device until the IRP_MN_START_DEVICE IRP completes, indicating that all the drivers for the device have performed their start operations.</LI>

	<LI>Because a <I>DispatchPnP</I> routine runs in the context of a system thread at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL, any memory allocated with <A HREF="k102_2omq.htm"><B>ExAllocatePoolWithTag</B></A> for use exclusively during initialization can be from paged pool as long as the driver does not control the device that holds a system page file. Such a memory allocation must be released with <A HREF="k102_6uuq.htm"><B>ExFreePool</B></A> before the <I>DispatchPnP</I> routine returns control.</LI>

	<LI>A WDM device driver's ISR should be capable of determining whether it has been called with a spurious interrupt <I>even during device startup</I>. On return from the call to <A HREF="k104_7h9u.htm"><B>IoConnectInterrupt</B></A> in the code path that handles IRP_MN_START_DEVICE, the ISR can be called immediately if interrupts are enabled on the device.</LI>
