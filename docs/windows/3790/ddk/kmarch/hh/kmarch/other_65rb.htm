<P>Any intermediate driver layered between a file system driver and a removable-media device driver must set up the next-lower-level driver’s I/O stack location in IRPs. From incoming <A HREF="k113_7fhu.htm">IRP_MJ_READ</A>, <A HREF="k113_45o2.htm">IRP_MJ_WRITE</A>, and <A HREF="k113_0hiq.htm">IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL</A> requests, the intermediate driver must copy its own I/O stack location <B>Flags</B> into the next-lower-level driver’s I/O stack location when it sets up the I/O stack location for the lower driver. </P>

<P>If the intermediate driver allocates new IRPs for lower-level removable-media drivers, it must set up those IRPs as follows:

<UL>
	<LI>For transfer requests, it must set up the thread context in each driver-allocated IRP from the value at <B>Tail.Overlay.Thread</B> in the original IRP.</LI>

	<LI>For IRP_MJ_READ, IRP_MJ_WRITE, and IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL requests, it must copy the I/O stack location <B>Flags</B> from the original IRP to each driver-allocated IRP.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Otherwise, the file system can neither maintain the integrity of cached file data nor cause the user to be prompted to remount the media that holds an open file.</P>
