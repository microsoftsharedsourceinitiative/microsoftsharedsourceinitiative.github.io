<P>If a device supports wake-up, its power policy owner must be able to enable and disable wake-up for the device. A driver enables wake up by sending an IRP_MJ_POWER request with minor function code IRP_MN_WAIT_WAKE and disables wake-up by canceling a previously sent IRP_MN_WAIT_WAKE. A device can have only one IRP_MN_WAIT_WAKE request pending at a time.</P>

<P>To determine whether its device supports wake-up, the device states from which it can signal wake-up, and the system states from which the device can wake the system, a driver checks the <B>SystemWake</B>, <B>DeviceWake</B>, and <B>WakeFromD</B><I>x</I> fields in the DEVICE_CAPABILITIES structure. </P>

<P>For more information about enabling, disabling, and responding to wake-up signals in a driver, see <A HREF="pwrmgmt_3l7r.htm">Supporting Devices That Have Wake-Up Capabilities</A>. </P>
