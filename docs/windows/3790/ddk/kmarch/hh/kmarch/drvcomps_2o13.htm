<P>Any driver that supports PnP must have an <A HREF="drvrrtns_4d6a.htm"><I>AddDevice</I></A> routine. The <I>AddDevice</I> routine creates one or more device objects representing the physical, logical, or virtual devices for which the driver carries out I/O requests. It also attaches the device object to the device stack, so the device stack will contain a device object for each driver associated with the device.</P>

<P>The PnP Manager calls a driver's <I>AddDevice</I> routine for each device controlled by the driver. <I>AddDevice</I> routines are called during system initialization (when devices are first enumerated), and any time a new device is enumerated while the system is running. </P>
