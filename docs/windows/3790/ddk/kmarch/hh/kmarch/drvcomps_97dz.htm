<H3><A NAME="ddk_a_pnp_driver_s_unload_routine_kg"></A>A PnP Driver's <I>Unload</I> Routine</H3>

<P>A PnP driver must have an <I>Unload</I> routine that removes any driver-specific resources, such as memory, threads, and events, that are created by the <B>DriverEntry</B> routine. If there are no driver-specific resources to remove, the driver must still have an <I>Unload</I> routine but it can simply return.</P>

<P>A driver's Unload routine can be called at any time after all the driver's devices have been removed. The PnP Manager calls a driver's Unload routine in the context of a system thread at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL.</P>

<P>PnP drivers free device-specific resources and device objects in response to PnP device-removal IRPs. The PnP Manager sends these IRPs on behalf of each PnP device it enumerates as well as any root-enumerated legacy devices a driver reports using <A HREF="k104_8o8i.htm"><B>IoReportDetectedDevice</B></A>. </P>

<P>Consequently, the <I>Unload</I> routines of PnP drivers are usually simple, often consisting only of a <B>Return</B> statement. However, if the driver allocated any driver-wide resources in its <B>DriverEntry</B> routine, it must deallocate those resources in its <I>Unload</I> routine unless it has already done so. In general, the process of unloading a PnP driver is a synchronous operation.</P>

<P>The I/O Manager frees the driver object and any driver object extension that the driver allocated using <A HREF="k104_1po2.htm"><B>IoAllocateDriverObjectExtension</B></A>.</P>
