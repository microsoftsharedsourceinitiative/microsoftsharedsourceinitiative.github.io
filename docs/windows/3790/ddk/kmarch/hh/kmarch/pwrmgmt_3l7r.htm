<P>Drivers for devices that can respond to external wake signals must be able to handle <A HREF="poirp_44fm.htm">IRP_MN_WAIT_WAKE</A> requests (<I>wait/wake IRPs</I>). The power policy owner for such a device must be able to send an IRP_MN_WAIT_WAKE request.</P>

<P>Typically, whatever causes the device to assert the wake signal is also a normal service event for the device. For example, user input, which might cause a keyboard to wake up the system, is a normal event for the keyboard and its drivers. </P>

<P>The first topic of this section, <A HREF="pwrmgmt_5f3b.htm">Overview of Wait/Wake Operation</A>, contains information useful in writing any driver. The following additional topics provide detailed information on handling and sending wait/wake IRPs:</P>
