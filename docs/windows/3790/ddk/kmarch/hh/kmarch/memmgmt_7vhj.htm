<P>You can make all or a portion of some drivers pageable. Paging driver code reduces the size of the driver's load image, thus freeing system space for other uses. It is most practical for drivers of sporadically-used devices, such as modems and CD-ROMs, or for portions of drivers that are rarely called.</P>

<P>Driver code must be pageable if the driver does any of the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Accesses paged pool</LI>

	<LI>Calls another pageable routine</LI>

	<LI>References user buffers in the context of the user thread</LI>
</UL>

<P>Driver code that does any of the following <I>must be resident</I>; it <I>cannot</I> be made pageable: 

<UL>
	<LI>Runs at or above IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL</LI>

	<LI>Acquires spin locks</LI>

	<LI>Calls any of the kernel's object support routines, such as <A HREF="k105_44du.htm"><B>KeReleaseMutex</B></A> or <A HREF="k105_1cmq.htm"><B>KeReleaseSemaphore</B></A>, in which the <I>Wait</I> parameter is set to TRUE. If the kernel is called with <I>Wait</I> set to TRUE, the call returns with IRQL at DISPATCH_LEVEL and the dispatcher database locked</LI>
</UL>

<P>As a general rule, it is worthwhile to make a pageable section if the total amount of all the pageable code (or data) is at least 4K. Whenever possible, you should isolate purely pageable code (or data) into a separate section from code (or data) that must be pageable or locked-on-demand. For instance, combining purely pageable and locked-on-demand code causes more system space to be locked down for the combined section than is necessary. However, if a driver has less than 4K of possibly pageable code (or data), you might combine that code (or data) with locked-on-demand code (or data) into one section, saving system space.</P>
