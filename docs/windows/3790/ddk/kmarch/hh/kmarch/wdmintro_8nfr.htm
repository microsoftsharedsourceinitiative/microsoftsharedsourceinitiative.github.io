<P>A <I>bus driver</I> services a bus controller, adapter, or bridge (see the <A HREF="wdmintro_3ep3.htm#ddk_figure_1.4_dg">Possible Driver Layers</A> figure). Microsoft provides bus drivers for most common buses, such as PCI, PnpISA, SCSI, and USB. Other bus drivers can be provided by IHVs or OEMs. Bus drivers are required drivers; there is one bus driver for each type of bus on a machine. A bus driver can service more than one bus if there is more than one bus of the same type on the machine.</P>

<P>The primary responsibilities of a bus driver are to: 

<UL>
	<LI>Enumerate the devices on its bus.</LI>

	<LI>Respond to Plug and Play IRPs and power management IRPs.</LI>

	<LI>Multiplex access to the bus (for some buses).</LI>

	<LI>Generically administer the devices on its bus.</LI>
</UL>

<P>During enumeration, a bus driver identifies the devices on its bus and creates device objects for them. (For information about device objects, see <A HREF="devobjts_678n.htm">Device Objects and Device Stacks</A>.) The method a bus driver uses to identify connected devices depends on the particular bus.</P>

<P>A bus driver performs certain operations on behalf of the devices on its bus, including accessing device registers to physically change the power state of a device. For example, when the device goes to sleep, the bus driver sets device registers to put the device in the proper device power state. </P>

<P>Note, however, that a bus driver does not handle read and write requests for the devices on its bus. Read and write requests to a device are handled by the device's <A HREF="wdmintro_27fr.htm">function driver</A>. Only if the device is being used in <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">raw mode</A> does the parent bus driver handle reads and writes for the device.</P>

<P>A bus driver acts as the function driver for its controller, adapter, or bridge, and therefore manages device power policy for these components.</P>

<P>A bus driver can be implemented as a driver/minidriver pair, the way a SCSI port/miniport driver pair drives a SCSI host bus adapter (HBA). In such driver pairs, the minidriver is linked to the second driver, which is a DLL.</P>
