<P>Use the following general guidelines for designing, writing, and calling <A HREF="drvrrtns_4m2a.htm"><I>SynchCritSection</I></A> routines that program a device for I/O operations: 

<UL>
	<LI>A <I>SynchCritSection</I> routine that programs the device for I/O operations must return control as quickly as possible.
<P>For this reason, the <I>SynchCritSection</I> routine should do only what is necessary to set up the device for I/O. Therefore, the driver should perform all IRP preprocessing, initializing state information for other driver routines, and acquiring hardware resources before it calls the <I>SynchCritSection</I> routine.
</LI>

	<LI>A device driver can have multiple <I>SynchCritSection</I> routines to program the device.
<P>For example, the driver of a device for which setting up a read request differs markedly from setting up certain device control requests might have separate <I>SynchCritSection</I> routines to program its device for each type of request.
</LI>

	<LI>Every <I>SynchCritSection</I> routine must return control as quickly as possible, because running any <I>SynchCritSection</I> routine prevents the driver’s ISR from executing.
<P>You should not write a single, large, general-purpose <I>SynchCritSection</I> routine with a <B>switch</B> statement or many nested <B>if..then..else</B> statements to determine what operations it will carry out or what state information to update. On the other hand, you should avoid writing numerous <I>SynchCritSection</I> routines that program only a single device register.
</LI>
