<P><B>ExSetResourceOwnerPointer</B>, used in conjunction with <B>ExReleaseResourceForThreadLite</B>, provides a means for one thread (acting as an resource manager thread) to acquire and release resources for use by another thread (acting as a resource user thread).</P>

<P>After calling <B>ExSetResourceOwnerPointer</B> for a specific resource, the only other routine that can be called for that resource is <B>ExReleaseResourceForThreadLite</B>.</P>

<P>The resource manager thread acquires ownership of the resource and passes ownership to the user thread by calling <B>ExSetResourceOwnerPointer</B>. The caller must allocate the memory for the ERESOURCE_THREAD value pointed to by <I>OwnerPointer</I> in system memory, and this memory must remain allocated until <B>ExReleaseResourceForThreadLite</B> returns. The caller must also set the two low-order bits of the ERESOURCE_THREAD value pointed to by <I>OwnerPointer</I> to one — this encoding is used internally by the resource services to distinguish between owner and thread addresses.</P>

<P>When the user thread is done with the resource, the resource manager thread releases the user thread's ownership of the resource by calling <B>ExReleaseResourceForThreadLite</B>. The <I>ResourceThreadId</I> input parameter is set to the value of the <I>OwnerPointer</I> parameter used in the previous call to <B>ExSetResourceOwnerPointer</B> that gave the worker thread ownership of the resource.</P>

<P>Callers of <B>ExSetResourceOwnerPointer </B>must be running at IRQL&nbsp;&lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.</P>
