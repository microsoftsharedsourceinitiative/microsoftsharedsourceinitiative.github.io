<P>Plug and Play provides: 

<UL>
	<LI>Automatic and dynamic recognition of installed hardware</LI>

	<LI>Hardware resource allocation (and reallocation)</LI>

	<LI>Loading of appropriate drivers</LI>

	<LI>An interface for drivers to interact with the PnP system</LI>

	<LI>Mechanisms for drivers and applications to learn of changes in the hardware environment</LI>
</UL>

<P>To support PnP, a driver must follow these guidelines:

<UL>
	<LI>It must contain a <A HREF="drvrrtns_8uya.htm"><I>DispatchPnP</I></A> routine.
<P>This dispatch routine must handle <A HREF="k113_8ur6.htm">IRP_MJ_PNP</A> requests and associated minor function codes. For more information, see <A HREF="drvcomps_7jjb.htm"><I>DispatchPnP</I> Routines</A>.
</LI>

	<LI>It must not search for hardware.
<P>The PnP Manager is responsible for determining the presence of hardware devices. When the PnP Manager detects a device, it notifies the driver by calling its <A HREF="drvrrtns_4d6a.htm"><I>AddDevice</I></A> routine. Hardware can be detected when the system is booted, or any time that a user adds a device to, or removes one from, a running system.
</LI>

	<LI>It must not allocate hardware resources.
<P>A PnP driver must provide the PnP Manager with lists of resources that a device can potentially use. The PnP Manager is responsible for assigning resources to each device, and notifying the driver of each device's assignments when it sends an <A HREF="pnp-irps_1gqa.htm">IRP_MN_START_DEVICE</A> request. The driver must thus be capable of working with various configurations of hardware resources.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>Some drivers are insulated from the details of the PnP and power management by system-supplied port or class drivers. For example, a SCSI port driver insulates a SCSI miniport driver from many of the details of the power and PnP systems, so a SCSI miniport driver doesn't need to handle power and PnP IRPs directly. For such drivers, see the driver-specific documentation for details of the required PnP support. </P>
