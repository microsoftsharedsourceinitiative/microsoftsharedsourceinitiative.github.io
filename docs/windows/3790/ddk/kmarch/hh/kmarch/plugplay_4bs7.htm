<P>The following figure shows the components that work together to support PnP.</P>

<P><B>PnP Software Components </B></P>

<P>The PnP Manager has two parts: the kernel-mode PnP Manager and the user-mode PnP Manager. The kernel-mode PnP Manager interacts with OS components and drivers to configure, manage, and maintain devices. The user-mode PnP Manager interacts with user-mode setup components, such as Class Installers, to configure and install devices. The user-mode PnP Manager also interacts with applications to, for example, register an application for notification of device changes and notify the application when a device event occurs. </P>

<P>PnP drivers support the physical, logical, and virtual devices on a machine. The term "PnP driver" refers to any Windows driver that supports the interfaces described in this section. While most PnP drivers are also WDM drivers and thus source-compatible across Windows platforms, a few drivers support PnP without fully implementing WDM. </P>

<P>All drivers should support PnP and power management. If a single driver does not support PnP and power management, it constrains the PnP and power management support of the system as a whole.</P>
