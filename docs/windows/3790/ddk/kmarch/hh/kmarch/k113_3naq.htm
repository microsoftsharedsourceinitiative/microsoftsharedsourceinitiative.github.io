<P>Every driver must handle close requests in a <A HREF="drvrrtns_64du.htm"><I>DispatchClose</I></A> routine, with the possible exception of a driver whose device cannot be disabled or removed from the machine without bringing down the system. A disk driver whose device holds the system page file is an example of such a driver. Note that the driver of such a device also cannot be unloaded dynamically.</P>

<H4>When Sent</H4>

<P>Receipt of this request indicates that the last handle of the file object that is associated with the target device object has been closed and released. All outstanding I/O requests have been completed or canceled.</P>

<H4>Input Parameters</H4>

<P>None</P>

<H4>Output Parameters</H4>

<P>None</P>

<H4>Operation</H4>

<P>Many device and intermediate drivers merely set STATUS_SUCCESS in the I/O status block of the IRP and complete the close request. However, what a given driver does on receipt of a close request depends on the driver’s design. In general, a driver should undo whatever actions it takes on receipt of the <A HREF="k113_02lu.htm">IRP_MJ_CREATE</A> request. Device drivers whose device objects are exclusive, such as a serial driver, also can reset the hardware on receipt of a close request.</P>

<P>The IRP_MJ_CLOSE request is not sent in the context of the process that closed the file object handle. If the driver must release process-specific resources, such as user memory, that the driver previously locked or mapped, it must do so in response to an <A HREF="k113_6vg2.htm">IRP_MJ_CLEANUP</A> request.</P>
