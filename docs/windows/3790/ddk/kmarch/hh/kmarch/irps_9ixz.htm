<P>Any higher-level driver can have a <I>StartIo </I>routine. However, such a driver is unlikely to be interoperable with existing lower-level drivers and is likely to exhibit poor performance characteristics. </P>

<P>A <I>StartIo </I>routine in a higher-level driver has the following effects:

<UL>
	<LI>Incoming IRPs can be queued by calling <B>IoStartPacket</B> from the driver’s Dispatch routine(s) and <B>IoStartNextPacket</B> from its <I>IoCompletion</I> routine(s), thereby causing IRPs to be processed one at a time through the <I>StartIo </I>routine.</LI>

	<LI>The driver’s I/O throughput could become noticeably slower during periods of heavy I/O demand, because its <I>StartIo </I>routine can become a bottleneck.</LI>

	<LI>The driver's <I>StartIo </I>routine calls <B>IoCallDriver</B> with each IRP at IRQL&nbsp;= DISPATCH_LEVEL, thereby causing all lower-level drivers’ dispatch routines also to run at IRQL&nbsp;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. This restricts the set of support routines that lower drivers can call in their dispatch routines. Because most driver writers assume their drivers’ dispatch routines run at IRQL&nbsp;&lt; DISPATCH_LEVEL, the higher-level driver is unlikely to be interoperable with many existing lower-level drivers. </LI>

	<LI>The <I>StartIo </I>routine reduces overall system throughput because it and the dispatch routines of all lower-level drivers in its chain are run at raised IRQL. 
<P>For more information about the IRQLs at which standard driver routines are run, see <A HREF="intrupts_0kh3.htm">Managing Hardware Priorities</A>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>None of the system-supplied higher-level drivers has a <I>StartIo </I>routine, because it can slow IRP processing for the driver itself, for all drivers above and below it, and for the system overall. </P>

<P>Most higher-level drivers simply send IRPs to lower-level drivers from their dispatch routines and do any necessary clean-up processing in their <I>IoCompletion</I> routines.</P>

<P>However, higher-level drivers can set up internal queues for IRPs that request particular kinds of operations, or set up internal queues to hold IRPs bound for a set of heterogeneous underlying devices like the SCSI port driver. For more information, see <A HREF="irps_4mqv.htm">Queuing and Dequeuing IRPs</A>.</P>
