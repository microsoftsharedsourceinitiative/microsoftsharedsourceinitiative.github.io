<P>The following AMD64 compiler features are related to the C and C++ languages:

<UL>
	<LI>This compiler conforms significantly to the ANSI/ISO standard. If the compiler generates build errors or warnings not seen in earlier versions, the errors might be a result of the increased conformance to the standard. Refer to the <A HREF="64bitamd_77s7.htm">Code Compatibility for AMD64</A> section for more information on the changes made.</LI>

	<LI>If the same virtual function is declared in two or more interfaces and if a class is derived from these interfaces, you can explicitly override each virtual function.</LI>

	<LI>Default packing (<B>/Zp</B>) is 16.</LI>

	<LI>The intrinsic functions <B>memset</B>, <B>memcpy</B>, and <B>memcmp</B> might call library functions. These intrinsic functions might not be expanded inline even if you compile with <B>/Oi</B>.</LI>

	<LI>You might need to change any code that does not specify the size of <B>time_t</B> and <B>size_t</B>. Both <B>size_t</B> and <B>time_t</B> are now <B>__int64</B>.</LI>

	<LI>If you get an error outputting a <B>size_t</B> to an I/O stream:
<P>Support for the 6.0 version of <B>iostream</B> is being phased out. Functionality for <B>iostream</B> is now provided through the standard C++ library. Details of the <B>iostream</B> implementation have changed. Therefore, you might need to rewrite parts of your code that use <B>iostream</B> if you want to link with the standard C++ library. 

<P>You will have to remove any old <B>iostream</B> headers (<I>fstream.h, iomanip.h, ios.h, iostream.h, istream.h, ostream.h, streamb.h,</I> and <I>strstream.h</I>) you have included in your code and add one or more of the new standard C++ <B>iostream</B> headers (<I>fstream, iomanip, ios, iosfwd, iostream, istream, ostream, sstream, streambuf, and strstream</I>, all without the <I>.h</I> extension).
