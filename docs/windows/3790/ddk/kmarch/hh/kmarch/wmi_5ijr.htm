<P>An <I>instance</I> of a WMI block contains data supplied by a particular physical device or software component. Just as a block's GUID uniquely identifies the block, an instance's name uniquely identifies that instance of a block. WMI client applications use instance names to associate the information returned in a data block with the device or component that supplied the data. WMI uses instance names to determine which device a request should be sent to. It is strongly recommended that drivers use their PDO when defining instance names.</P>

<P>A driver can define instance names for a block in either of two ways:

<UL>
	<LI>The driver passes a list of <I>static instance names</I> to WMI when it registers the block. 
<P>After the block is registered, both the driver and WMI specify an instance name by its index into this list. Static instance names can be based on the <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">device instance ID</A> of a driver's PDO, or a driver-defined base name; or the driver can define a list of instance name strings. Static instance names persist until the driver explicitly changes them by reregistering the block. 
</LI>

	<LI>The driver generates <I>dynamic instance names </I>as instances are created. 
<P>The driver indicates that it will generate dynamic instance names for a block when it registers the block. After the block is registered, both the driver and WMI pass dynamic instance names as strings in the buffer at <B>Parameters.WMI.Buffer</B>. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>A driver should generate dynamic instance names only if the number of instances or instance names of a data block change frequently at runtime. For example, a driver might use process IDs or the IP addresses of TCP/IP connections as instance names. Such instance names should be dynamic; if they were static, the driver would incur considerable overhead because it would have to call <A HREF="k104_5dbm.htm"><B>IoWMIRegistrationControl</B></A> to update the number and names of instances each time a change occurred. </P>

<P>In most cases, static instance names are preferable to dynamic instance names for the following reasons: 

<UL>
	<LI>Static instance names improve a driver's performance because the driver does not need to return instance name strings in response to WMI requests, as it must for dynamic instance names. </LI>

	<LI>WMI can detect static instance name collisions at registration and automatically modify the instance names if necessary, so that all instance names are unique for a given block no matter how many drivers register the block.
<P>WMI cannot detect instance name collisions for dynamic instance names, so the driver is responsible for generating unique names using <A HREF="k104_14qa.htm"><B>IoWMIAllocateInstanceIds</B></A>. 
</LI>

	<LI>A driver can use the WMI Library routines to handle IRPs for a block that uses static instance names, as long as the names are based on the driver's PDO or a driver-defined base name. 
<P>A driver cannot use WMI Library routines to handle IRPs for a data block that uses dynamic instance names. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>A driver indicates whether a block uses static or dynamic instance names, and the type of static instance names, by setting or clearing WMIREG_FLAG_XXX in the <A HREF="k112_3ulu.htm">WMIREGGUID</A> or <A HREF="k112_52uq.htm">WMIGUIDREGINFO</A> structure it passes to WMI when it registers the block.
