<P>A <I>section object</I> represents a section of memory that can be shared. A process can use a section object to share portions of its memory address space (memory sections) with other processes. Section objects also provide the mechanism by which a process can map a file into its memory address space.</P>

<P>Each memory section has one or more corresponding <I>views</I>. A view of a section is a portion of the section that is actually visible to a process. The act of creating a view for a section is known as <I>mapping</I> a view of the section. Each process that is manipulating the contents of a section has its own view; a process can also have multiple views (to the same or different sections).</P>
