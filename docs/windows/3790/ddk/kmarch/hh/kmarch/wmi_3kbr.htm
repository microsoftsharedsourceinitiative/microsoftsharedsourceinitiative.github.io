<P>A driver can call <A HREF="k902_43hu.htm"><B>WmiFireEvent</B></A> to send events that do not use dynamic instance names, and that base static instance names on a single base name string or the device instance ID of a PDO. </P>

<P>The event must be a single instance of a block—that is, a driver cannot call <B>WmiFireEvent</B> to send an event that consists of a single item or multiple instances. To send such events, a driver must call <A HREF="k104_2uya.htm"><B>IoWMIWriteEvent</B></A>, as described in <A HREF="wmi_0eg7.htm">Sending an Event with <B>IoWMIWriteEvent</B></A>.</P>

<P>A driver should not send events until WMI has enabled the event. After the event has been enabled, when the event's trigger condition occurs, the driver:

<OL>
	<LI>Allocates a buffer from the nonpaged pool and writes the event data to the buffer. If the event has no data, the driver can skip this step.</LI>

	<LI>Calls <A HREF="k902_43hu.htm"><B>WmiFireEvent</B></A> with the following parameters:
<UL>
	<LI>A pointer to the driver's device object</LI>

	<LI>A pointer to the GUID that represents the event block</LI>

	<LI>If the event block has multiple instances, the index of the instance</LI>

	<LI>If data is to be sent with the event, the number of bytes of data, or 0 if none</LI>

	<LI>If data is to be sent with the event, a pointer to the driver-allocated buffer that contains the data, or NULL if none</LI>
</UL>

<P>The driver must allocate all parameters passed to <B>WmiFireEvent</B>, including the event data buffer, from nonpaged pool. WMI releases the driver-allocated memory without further intervention by the driver. 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>After <B>WmiFireEvent</B> returns, the driver resumes monitoring the event's trigger condition and sends the event each time its trigger condition occurs until WMI disables that event.</P>
