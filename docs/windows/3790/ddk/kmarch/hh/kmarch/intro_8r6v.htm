<P>There are two basic kinds of Windows drivers:

<UL>
	<LI><I>User-mode drivers</I> (such as some printer driver components, along with Win32® VDDs for MS-DOS® applications and application-dedicated devices) or another protected subsystem's drivers.
<P>User-mode drivers are subsystem-specific. See <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">Introduction to Printing</A> for more information about printer driver components.
</LI>

	<LI><I>Kernel-mode drivers</I> for logical, virtual, or physical devices.
<P>These drivers run as part of the <I> </I>Executive, which consists of kernel-mode operating system components that manage I/O, Plug and Play, memory, processes and threads, security, and so on. 

<P>Some kernel-mode drivers are also <I>WDM drivers</I>, which conform to the <A HREF="wdmintro_576v.htm">Windows Driver Model</A> (WDM)<I>.</I> All WDM drivers support Plug and Play, and power management. WDM drivers are source-compatible (but not binary-compatible) across the Microsoft Windows® &nbsp;98/Me and Windows&nbsp;2000 and later operating systems. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>Like the operating system itself, kernel-mode drivers are implemented as discrete, modular components with a well-defined set of required functionality. All kernel-mode drivers supply a set of system-defined <A HREF="drvrrtns_99rm.htm"><I>standard driver routines</I></A>.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/1drvlyrs.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><B>Types of Kernel-Mode Drivers</B></P>

<P>There are three basic types of kernel-mode drivers, as shown in the previous figure. Each type has a slightly different structure and quite different functionality:

<OL>
	<LI><I>Highest level drivers</I>, such as the system-supplied FAT, NTFS, and CDFS <I>file system drivers</I> (FSDs). Highest-level drivers always depend on support from underlying lower level drivers.
<P>While a particular file system driver might or might not get support from one or more intermediate drivers, every file system driver ultimately depends on support from one or more underlying peripheral device (and possibly PnP hardware bus<I>)</I> drivers.
</LI>

	<LI><I>Intermediate drivers</I>, such as a virtual disk, mirror, or device-type-specific <I>class</I> <I>driver</I>. Intermediate drivers also depend on support from underlying lower level drivers.
<P><I>PnP function drivers</I> that control specific peripheral devices on an I/O bus controlled by a PnP hardware bus driver are intermediate drivers, as are <I>PnP filter drivers</I> that insert themselves above or below PnP function drivers in the <I>driver stack</I> for any particular peripheral device. A subset of PnP function and filter drivers are also <I>WDM function </I>and <I>filter</I> drivers.

<P>Any system-supplied<I> class driver</I> that exports a system-defined WDM class/miniclass interface is, in effect, an intermediate driver with one or more linked <I>WDM miniclass drivers (</I>sometimes called <I>WDM minidrivers)</I>. Each linked WDM class/minidriver pair provides functionality equivalent to that of a WDM function driver or a WDM "software" bus driver. 

<P><I>PnP software bus drivers</I> that present a set of child devices to which still higher level class, function, and/or filter drivers can attach themselves are also intermediate drivers. For example, a driver that controls a multifunction adapter with an on-board set of heterogeneous devices is a PnP software bus driver. Depending on the nature of the on-board devices and the interfaces used by its driver, such a driver also might be a WDM software bus driver. It would appear to still higher level drivers to be a PnP/WDM bus driver. To the operating system, the driver would appear as a PnP/WDM function driver for its own adapter that inserted itself into the driver stack over an underlying PnP hardware bus driver.
</LI>

	<LI><I>Lowest-level drivers</I>, such as <I>PnP hardware bus drivers</I> that control an I/O bus on which some number of peripheral devices are connected. Lowest-level drivers do not depend on lower-level drivers, but control a physical peripheral device such as a bus.
<P><A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_2.Click()">Legacy drivers</A> that control a physical peripheral device directly are lowest-level drivers, as are drivers such as the SCSI HBA (host bus adapter) driver. 

<P>PnP hardware bus drivers are system-supplied and usually control dynamically configurable I/O buses. The driver collaborates with the Plug and Play Manager to configure and reconfigure system hardware resources (such as mappings for device memory and IRQs) for all child devices connected to the I/O buses it controls. For its I/O buses, a PnP hardware bus driver subsumes some of the functionality that was provided exclusively by the HAL component in releases of the NT-based operating system prior to Windows 2000.
