<P>The extent to which a device supports PnP depends on the PnP support in both the device hardware and the device drivers (see the following table).</P>

<P>Any device that supports PnP should have PnP support in its drivers. </P>

<P>A non-PnP device can have some PnP capability if it is driven by a PnP driver. For example, an ISA sound card or an EISA network card can be manually installed and then a PnP driver can treat the card like a PnP device. </P>

<P>If a driver does not support PnP, its devices behave as non-PnP devices regardless of any hardware PnP support. A non-PnP driver can constrain the PnP and power management capabilities of the whole system. </P>

<P><I>Legacy drivers</I> (that is, drivers written before the operating system supported PnP) continue to work as they did previously, without any PnP capability. New drivers should include PnP support.</P>
