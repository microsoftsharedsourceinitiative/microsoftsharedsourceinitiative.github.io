<P>The Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) is used to represent security descriptors. Security for device objects can be specified by an SDDL string that is placed in an INF file or passed to <A HREF="k104_1ycy.htm"><B>IoCreateDeviceSecure</B></A>. The Security Descriptor Definition Language is fully documented in the Platform SDK documentation. </P>

<P>While INF files support the full range of SDDL, only a subset of the language is supported by the <B>IoCreateDeviceSecure</B> routine. This subset is defined here.</P>

<P>SDDL strings for device objects are of the form "D:P" followed by one or more expressions of the form "(A;;<I>Access</I>;;;<I>SID</I>)". The <I>SID</I> value specifies a security identifier that determines to whom the <I>Access</I> value applies (for example, a user or group). The <I>Access</I> value specifies the access rights allowed for the SID. The <I>Access</I> and <I>SID</I> values are as follows 

<DL>
<DT><I>Access</I> </DT>

<DD>Specifies an <A HREF="k112_9sfm.htm">ACCESS_MASK</A> value that determines the allowed access. This value can be written either as a hex value in the form "0x<I>hex</I>", or as a sequence of two-letter symbolic codes that represent access rights.

<P>The following codes can be used to specify generic access rights.

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=14%>RC</TD>
<TD width=86%>Restricted Code
<P>This SID is used to control access by untrusted code. ACL validation against tokens with RC consists of <I>two</I> checks, one against the token's normal list of SIDs (containing WD for instance), and one against a second list (typically containing RC and a subset of the original token SIDs). Access is granted only if a token passes both tests. As such, RC actually works in <I>combination</I> with other SIDs.</P>

<P>Any ACL that specifies RC must also specify WD. When RC is paired with WD in an ACL, a superset of Everyone <I>including</I> untrusted code is described. </P>

<P>Untrusted code might be code launched using the Run As option in Explorer. By default, World does not cover untrusted code.</P>

<H4>SDDL Examples For Device Objects</H4>

<P>This section describes the predefined SDDL strings found in <I>wdmsec.h</I>. You can also use these as templates to define new SDDL strings for device objects.</P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD colspan=2 width=52%>SDDL_DEVOBJ_KERNEL_ONLY</TD>
<TD width=48%><B>“D:P”</B></TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=8%>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD colspan=2 width=92%>SDDL_DEVOBJ_KERNEL_ONLY is the "empty" ACL. User mode code (including processes running as system) cannot open the device.
<P>A PnP bus driver could use this descriptor when creating a PDO. The INF file could then specify looser security settings for the device. By specifying this descriptor, the bus driver would ensure that no attempt to open the device before the INF was processed would succeed. </P>

<P>Similarly, a non-WDM driver could use this descriptor to make its device objects inaccessible until the appropriate user-mode program (such as an installer) sets the final security descriptor in the registry.</P>

<P>In all of these cases, the default is tight security, loosened as necessary.</P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD colspan=2 width=52%>SDDL_DEVOBJ_SYS_ALL</TD>
<TD width=48%><B>“D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)”</B></TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=8%>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD colspan=2 width=92%>SDDL_DEVOBJ_SYS_ALL is similar to SDDL_DEVOBJ_KERNEL_ONLY, except that in addition to kernel-mode code, user-mode code running as System is also allowed to open the device for any access. 
<P>A legacy driver might use this ACL to start with tight security settings, and let its service open the device up at run time to individual users by using the <B>SetFileSecurity</B> user-mode function. In this case, the service would have to be running as System. </P>
