<P>Kernel-mode objects are either named or unnamed.  The <I>object name</I> is a Unicode string that both user-mode and kernel-mode components can use to refer to the object.  For example, <B>\KernelObjects\LowMemoryCondition</B> is the name of the standard event object that signals when the amount of free memory in the system is low.</P>

<P>Both user-mode and kernel-mode components use the object name to open a handle to an object.  All subsequent operations are performed by using the handle.</P>

<P>If an object is unnamed, a user-mode component <I>cannot</I> open a handle to it.  Kernel-mode components can refer to an unnamed object by either a pointer or a handle.</P>

<P>Named objects are organized into a hierarchy.  Each object is named relative to a parent object.  Each component of the object's name begins with a backslash character.  For example, <B>\KernelObjects</B> is the parent object for <B>\KernelObjects\LowMemoryCondition</B>.</P>

<P>Only some types of objects can have child objects.  The following are some examples:

<UL>
	<LI>Object directories have child objects.  The Object Manager uses object directories to organize objects.  For example <B>\KernelObjects</B> is an object directory that holds standard event objects.  Object directories do not correspond to actual directories on a disk.  For more information, see <A HREF="objects_2kyv.htm">Object Directories</A>.</LI>

	<LI>Device objects for disk drives have child objects that correspond to files on the disk.</LI>

	<LI>File objects that represent directories have child objects corresponding to files within the directory.</LI>

	<LI>Device objects for WDM drivers have their own namespace that can be used in a driver-defined fashion.  For more information, see <A HREF="devobjts_7mav.htm">Controlling Device Namespace Access</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Files have object names that are relative to <B>\DosDevices</B>.  For example, the file <I>C:\Directory\FIle</I> can be specified as <B>\DosDevices\C:\</B><I>Directory\File</I>.</P>

<P>For example, the components of the object name can be described as follows.</P>
