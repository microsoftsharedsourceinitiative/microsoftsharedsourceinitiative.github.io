<P>The required functionality of a particular dispatch routine varies, depending on the I/O function code it handles, on the individual driver’s position in a chain of drivers, and on the type of underlying physical device. </P>

<P>Most dispatch routines process incoming I/O request packets (IRPs) as follows:

<OL>
	<LI>Check the driver’s I/O stack location in the IRP to determine what to do and check the parameters, if any, for validity. 
<P>Whether a driver must check its I/O stack location to determine what to do and to check parameters depends on the given IRP_MJ_<I>XXX</I>, as well as on whether that driver set up a separate Dispatch routine for each IRP_MJ_<I>XXX</I> that the driver handles.
</LI>

	<LI>Satisfy the request and complete the IRP if possible; otherwise, pass it on for further processing by lower-level drivers or by other device driver routines. 
<P>Whether a driver must pass on an IRP for further processing depends on the validity of the parameters, if any, as well as on the IRP_MJ_<I>XXX</I> and on the driver’s level, if any, in a chain of layered drivers.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>For more information about IRPs, see <A HREF="irps_0uuf.htm">Handling IRPs</A>.</P>
