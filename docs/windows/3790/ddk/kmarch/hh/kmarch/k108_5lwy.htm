<DL>
<DT><I>NotifyRoutine</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the entry point of a caller-supplied process-creation callback routine.</DD>

<DT><I>Remove</I></DT>

<DD>Indicates whether the routine specified by <I>NotifyRoutine</I> should be added to or removed from the system's list of notification routines. If FALSE, the specified routine is added to the list. If TRUE, the specified routine is removed from the list.

<H4>Return Value</H4>

<P><B>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine</B> can return one of the following:

<DL>
<DT>STATUS_SUCCESS</DT>

<DD>The given <I>NotifyRoutine</I> is now registered with the system. </DD>

<DT>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</DT>

<DD>The given <I>NotifyRoutine</I> has already been registered so this is a redundant call, or the system has reached its limit for registering process-creation callbacks. 
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>Highest-level drivers can call <B>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine</B> to set up their process-creation notify routines, declared as follows:</P>

<PRE>VOID
(*PCREATE_PROCESS_NOTIFY_ROUTINE) (
    IN HANDLE  ParentId,
    IN HANDLE  ProcessId,
    IN BOOLEAN  Create
    );</PRE>

<P>The <I>ParentId</I> and <I>ProcessId</I> parameters identify the process, and the <I>Create</I> parameter indicates whether the process was created (TRUE) or deleted (FALSE).</P>

<P>An IFS or highest-level system-profiling driver might register a process-creation callback to track the system-wide creation and deletion of processes against the driver's internal state. The system can register up to eight process-creation callbacks. Any driver that successfully registers a callback <I>must remain loaded until the system itself is shut down</I>. </P>

<P>After a driver-supplied routine is registered, it is called with <I>Create</I> set to TRUE just after the initial thread is created within the newly created process designated by the input <I>ProcessId</I> handle. The input <I>ParentId</I> handle identifies the parent process of the newly created process if it inherits open handles from its parent. </P>

<P>A driver's process-notify routine is also called with <I>Create</I> set to FALSE, usually when the last thread within a process has terminated and the process address space is about to be deleted. In very rare circumstances, for processes in which no thread was ever created, a driver's process-notify routine is called only at the destruction of the process. </P>

<P>The driver's process-creation notify routine runs at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL, either in the context of the initial thread within a newly created process or in the context of a system thread. </P>

<P>Callers of <B>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine</B> must be running at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL.</P>
