<P>Most drivers’ dispatch routines are called in an arbitrary thread context at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL, with the following exceptions:

<UL>
	<LI>Any highest-level driver’s dispatch routines are called in the context of the thread that originated the I/O request, which is commonly a user-mode application thread.
<P>In other words, the dispatch routines of file system drivers and other highest-level drivers are called in a nonarbitrary thread context at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL. 
</LI>

	<LI>The <I>DispatchRead</I>, <I>DispatchWrite</I>, and <I>DispatchDeviceControl</I> routines of lowest-level device drivers, and of intermediate drivers layered above them in the system paging path, can be called at IRQL = APC_LEVEL and in an arbitrary thread context. 
<P>The <I>DispatchRead</I> and/or <I>DispatchWrite</I> routines, and any other routine that also processes read and/or write requests in such a lowest-level device or intermediate driver, <I>must be resident at all times</I>. These driver routines can neither be pageable nor be part of a driver’s pageable-image section; they must not access any pageable memory. Furthermore, they should not be dependent on any blocking calls (such as <B>KeWaitForSingleObject</B> with a nonzero time-out). 
</LI>

	<LI>The <I>DispatchPower</I> routine of drivers in the hibernation and/or paging paths can be called at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL. The <I>DispatchPnP</I> routines of such drivers must be prepared to handle PnP <A HREF="pnp-irps_1wmq.htm">IRP_MN_DEVICE_USAGE_NOTIFICATION</A> requests. </LI>

	<LI>The <I>DispatchPower</I> routine of drivers that require inrush power at start-up can be called at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL. </LI>
</UL>
