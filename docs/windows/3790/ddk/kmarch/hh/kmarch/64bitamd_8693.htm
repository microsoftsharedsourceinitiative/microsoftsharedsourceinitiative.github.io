<P>If the UNW_FLAG_CHAININFO flag is set in the <B>Flags</B> member of the <A HREF="64bitamd_5rc7.htm">UNWIND_INFO Structure</A>, then this UNWIND_INFO structure is a secondary one. This secondary UNWIND_INFO contains an image-relative pointer in the <B>FunctionEntry</B> member. This image-relative pointer points to the <B>UnwindData</B> member of the <A HREF="64bitamd_4y7b.htm">RUNTIME_FUNCTION Structure</A> entry that points to the primary unwind information.</P>

<P>Chained information is useful in two situations. First, it can be used for noncontiguous code segments, like those produced by BBT. Using chained information can reduce the size of the necessary unwind information, because it is not required to duplicate the unwind codes array from the primary unwind information.</P>

<P>Chained information can also be used to handle shrink-wrapping of volatile register saves. The compiler can choose to delay saving some volatile registers until outside of the function entry prolog. This can be recorded by having primary unwind information for the portion of the function before the shrink-wrapped code, then setting up chained information with a nonzero size of prolog, where the unwind codes in the chained information reflect saves of the nonvolatile registers. In that case, the unwind codes are all instances of UWOP_SAVE_NONVOL. AMD64 does not support shrink-wrapping that saves nonvolatile registers using a PUSH, nor shrink-wrapping that modifies RSP with an additional fixed-stack allocation.</P>

<P>An UNWIND_INFO item with UNW_FLAG_CHAININFO set can point to a RUNTIME_FUNCTION entry whose UNWIND_INFO item also has UNW_FLAG_CHAININFO set (multiple shrink-wrapping). Eventually, following the chained unwind information, a pointer arrives at an UNWIND_INFO item with UNW_FLAG_CHAININFO cleared, which is the primary UNWIND_INFO item pointing to the actual procedure entry point.</P>
