<P>Power management is a system-wide, integrated approach to the use and conservation of power. Computer systems that include hardware and software support for power management provide for the following: 

<UL>
	<LI>Minimal startup and shutdown delays
<P>The system can sleep in a low-power state from which it can resume operation without a complete reboot. From the user's perspective, waking the computer from such a state is roughly comparable to switching on a television set.
</LI>

	<LI>Greater overall power efficiency and battery life
<P>Power is applied to devices only when they are delivering function to the user. If a device is not in use, it can be powered off and then powered up later, on demand.
</LI>

	<LI>Quieter operation 
<P>Powering down unused devices reduces noise. In addition, hardware and software can manage electrical current load and thermal load, resulting in computers that are nearly inaudible when sleeping.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>The industry-wide OnNow Initiative defines the hardware and software requirements for power management. For more information, see <A HREF="pwrmgmt_19d3.htm">Industry Initiatives for Power Management</A>.</P>

<P>In systems that support power management, the computer and its peripheral devices are maintained at the lowest feasible power level to accomplish the tasks at hand. Drivers cooperate with the operating system to manage power for their devices. If all drivers support power management, the operating system can manage power consumption on a system-wide basis, thus conserving power, shutting down and resuming quickly, and waking up when required. </P>

<P>This integrated approach to power management — involving the operating system, system hardware, device drivers, and device hardware — results in the following:

<UL>
	<LI>More intelligent power management decisions. At each level, the best-informed component directs power usage. </LI>

	<LI>Greater reliability. Better power management decisions reduce the chance of ill-timed shutdowns and loss of data.</LI>

	<LI>Platform independence. The operating system manages power in a controlled, uniform way across different hardware platforms, allowing maximum conservation of power on various devices. </LI>

	<LI>Better device integration. Device drivers that conform to industry-wide specifications ensure maximum conservation regardless of the hardware platform.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Combined, these advantages result in greater power conservation and more efficient usage than has previously been possible.</P>
