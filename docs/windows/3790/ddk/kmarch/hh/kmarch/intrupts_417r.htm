<P>Each driver of a physical device that generates interrupts must register an <A HREF="drvrrtns_29ma.htm"><I>InterruptService</I></A> routine (ISR) before it starts the device. When a driver registers an ISR, the system creates an <I>interrupt object</I>. These system-defined objects are used to store the following information:

<UL>
	<LI>The set of processors on which interrupts can occur (processor <I>affinity</I>)
<P>The system creates an interrupt object for each processor the device is capable of interrupting. However, the system can perform load balancing by restricting a particular device interrupt to a subset of available processors.
</LI>

	<LI>The system-assigned interrupt vectors for each device on each I/O bus in the machine
<P>For multibus machines, the PnP Manager maps bus-relative interrupt vectors of the devices on each I/O bus to a set of system-assigned interrupt vectors. 
</LI>

	<LI>The <A HREF="intrupts_0kh3.htm#ddk_dirql_kg">DIRQL</A> assigned to each system interrupt vector
<P>For a lowest-level driver, the DIRQL value assigned to its mapped system vector determines the hardware priority at which that driver's ISR executes.
</LI>

	<LI>The address of the <I>InterruptService</I> routine, which will be called when the device interrupts.</LI>

	<LI>Additional information for internal use by the system.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The PnP Manager queries bus drivers for configuration information (such as processor affinity, DIRQ, interrupt vector, and so on) during enumeration, and passes the information to drivers as <A HREF="plugplay_1xk7.htm">hardware resources</A> during device start-up operations.</P>

<P>A platform-specific HAL provides hardware-specific software support for the I/O buses, peripherals, and processors in each machine. The PnP Manager communicates with the HAL to obtain information about platform-specific support, which it can then supply to drivers. Drivers then use this information when registering ISRs.</P>

<P>Use of interrupt objects enables drivers to be portable across all Windows platforms, including SMP machines with several I/O buses of various types (ISA, EISA, PCI and so forth). This portability is possible because drivers do not access hardware directly; instead, they pass interrupt object pointers to system routines that access object contents.</P>

<P>Drivers do not directly access the contents of interrupt objects, and their structure is not documented.</P>
