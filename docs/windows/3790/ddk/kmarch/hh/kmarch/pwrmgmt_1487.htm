<P>To send an <A HREF="poirp_44fm.htm">IRP_MN_WAIT_WAKE</A>, a driver calls <A HREF="portn_55gy.htm"><B>PoRequestPowerIrp</B></A>, passing (among other parameters) a pointer to the target PDO, a system power state, and a pointer to a callback routine. </P>

<P>The system power state specifies the least-powered state from which this IRP can wake the system. The value must be equal to or more powered than the <A HREF="pwrmgmt_4exz.htm"><B>SystemWake</B></A> state in the <A HREF="k112_22r6.htm">DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</A> structure. For example, if a driver passes <B>PowerSystemSleeping2</B> in the IRP, the associated IRP could cause the system to wake from states S0, S1, and S2. In such a case, the system must support S0 and S2 (the highest- and lowest-powered states in the range) but need not support S1.  </P>

<P>Every driver that requests a wait/wake IRP should specify a <A HREF="pwrmgmt_27fr.htm">callback routine</A>, which is invoked after all other drivers have completed the IRP. In this routine, the driver can do whatever is necessary to return its device to the working state. </P>

<P>In response to <B>PoRequestPowerIrp</B>, the Power Manager allocates a power IRP with minor code IRP_MN_WAIT_WAKE and sends it to the top of the device stack for the target PDO. The caller is returned a pointer to the allocated IRP, which it can use later if it has to cancel the IRP. </P>

<P>If no errors occur, <B>PoRequestPowerIrp</B> returns STATUS_PENDING. This status means that the IRP has been sent successfully and is pending completion. </P>

<P>A wait/wake IRP does not change the power state of the system or of a device. It simply enables a device's wake-up signal. The IRP remains pending until an external signal causes the system or device to awaken. </P>
