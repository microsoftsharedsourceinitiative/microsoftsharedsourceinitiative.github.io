<P>Some drivers fail to distinguish the tasks required in <I>DispatchCleanup</I> and <I>DispatchClose</I> routines. The I/O Manager calls a driver's <I>DispatchCleanup</I> routine when the last handle to a file object is closed. The <I>DispatchClose</I> routine is called when the last reference is released from the file object. A driver should not attempt to free resources in its <I>DispatchCleanup</I> routine that are attached to a file object or might be used by other <I>Dispatch</I> routines. </P>

<P>When calling dispatch routines, the I/O Manager holds a reference to the file object for normal I/O calls. As a result, a driver can receive I/O requests for a file object after its <I>DispatchCleanup</I> routine has been called but before its <I>DispatchClose</I> routine is called. For example, a user-mode caller might close the file handle while an I/O Manager request is in progress from another thread. If the driver has deleted or freed necessary resources before the I/O Manager calls its <I>DispatchClose</I> routine, invalid pointer references and other problems could occur. </P>
