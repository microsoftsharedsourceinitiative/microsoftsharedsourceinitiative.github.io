<P>The <B>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</B> routine allocates zero-filled, nonpaged, physical memory pages to an MDL.</P>

<PRE class=syntax><B>PMDL

<H4>Parameters</H4>

<DL>
<DT><I>LowAddress</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the physical address of the start of the first address range from which the allocated pages can come. If <B>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</B> can not allocate the requested number of bytes in the first address range, it iterates through additional address ranges to get more pages. At each iteration <B>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</B> adds the value of <I>SkipBytes</I> to the previous start address to obtain the start of the next address range.</DD>

<DT><I>HighAddress</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the physical address of the end of the first address range from which the allocated pages can come. </DD>

<DT><I>SkipBytes</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of bytes to skip from the start of the previous address range from which the allocated pages can come. <I>SkipBytes</I> must be an integer multiple of the system's page size, in bytes.</DD>

<DT><I>TotalBytes</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the total number of bytes to allocate for the MDL.
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Return Value</H4>

<P><B>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</B> returns one of the following:

<DL>
<DT>MDL pointer</DT>

<DD>The MDL pointer describes a set of physical pages in the specified address range. If the requested number of bytes is not available, the MDL describes as much physical memory as is available. </DD>

<DT>NULL</DT>

<DD>There are no physical memory pages in the specified address ranges, or there is not enough memory pool for the MDL itself.</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Headers</H4>

<P>Declared in <I>ntddk.h</I>. Include <I>ntddk.h</I>.</P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>The physical memory pages returned by <B>MmAllocatedPagesForMdl</B> are typically not contiguous pages.</P>

<P><B>MmAllocatedPagesForMdl</B> is designed to be used by kernel-mode drivers that achieve substantial performance gains if physical memory for a device is allocated in a specific physical address range. A driver for an AGP graphics card is an example of such a driver.</P>

<P>Depending on how much physical memory is currently available in the requested ranges, <B>MmAllocatedPagesForMdl</B> might return an MDL that describes less memory than was requested. The routine returns NULL if no memory was allocated. The caller should check the amount of memory that is actually allocated to the MDL. </P>

<P>The caller must use <A HREF="k106_1noy.htm"><B>MmFreePagesFromMdl</B></A> to release the memory pages that are described by an MDL that was created by <B>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</B>. After calling <B>MmFreePagesFromMdl</B>, the caller must also call <A HREF="k102_6uuq.htm"><B>ExFreePool</B></A> to release the memory allocated for the MDL structure.</P>

<P><B>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</B> runs at IRQL&nbsp;&lt;= APC_LEVEL.</P>
