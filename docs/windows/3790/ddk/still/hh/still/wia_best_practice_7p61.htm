<P>WIA drivers should not start other processes on the system. The two most important reasons for this are the following:

<OL>
	<LI>Calling <B>CreateProcess</B> (described in the Platform SDK documentation)  starts the process under the same account in which the service was launched. In Windows&nbsp;XP, this is the <B>LocalSystem</B> account, which is a significant security risk.</LI>

	<LI>Calling <B>CreateProcessAsUser</B> (described in the Platform SDK documentation) can be difficult in a Fast User Switching (FUS) or Terminal Services (TS) environment. Incorrectly implemented components at this level can easily lead to successful escalation of privilege or information disclosure attacks.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The <B>LocalService</B> account does not have sufficient privileges to start other processes. Therefore, on Windows&nbsp;Server 2003 and later, WIA drivers cannot create processes.</P>

<P>If another process is required for device functionality, it is recommended that it be implemented as a system service or local COM server. See the MSDN documentation for specific security information related to the creation of system services and COM servers.</P>
