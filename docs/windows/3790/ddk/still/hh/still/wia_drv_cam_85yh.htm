<P>In the USB Still Image Capture Device Definition (SICDD), the device is allowed to cancel an operation at any time by returning less data than the host is expecting.</P>

<P>Currently, the driver does not handle this cancel mechanism. Instead, it treats cancellation of an operation as an error.</P>

<P>The driver also does not use the cancel mechanism from the host side. If the user cancels an operation on the host, the driver reads the remainder of the data from the device and then discards it.</P>
