<P>It is important to remember that a user-mode minidriver can be called either from an application (through an image acquisition API), or from the Still Image Event Monitor (which is implemented as a Windows®&nbsp;2000 service). There are security implications associated with these multiple calling sources. For example, if a user-mode minidriver creates a mutex using the default security descriptor (by specifying a NULL security descriptor), one mutex cannot be shared between an instance of the minidriver called from the Event Monitor and one called from an image acquisition API.</P>
