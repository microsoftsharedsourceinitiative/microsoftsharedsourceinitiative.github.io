<P>All still image devices have specific characteristics that describe that device. For example, two characteristics of a flatbed scanner are its horizontal and vertical bed sizes. A possible characteristic of a digital still camera is its battery status, which indicates remaining battery life.</P>

<P>Similarly, data produced or stored by the device can also be described with characteristics. For example, the data produced by a scanner can be described by the number of pixels on a line and the number of bits per pixel.  </P>

<P>In WIA, characteristics describing both devices and data are referred to as <I>properties</I>. Properties exist in sets and are maintained by the WIA minidriver in a WIA driver item.  </P>
