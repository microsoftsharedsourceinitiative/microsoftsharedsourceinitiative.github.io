<P>The WIA service notifies a WIA minidriver of a supported device event by calling the <A HREF="minidrv_41ex.htm"><B>IWiaMiniDrv::drvNotifyPnpEvent</B></A> method. In this method, the minidriver implements the device-specific functionality needed to respond to the event. The WIA service calls the <B>IWiaMiniDrv::drvNotifyPnpEvent</B> method only for an event the minidriver has indicated the device can support in the <A HREF="minidrv_3ctl.htm"><B>IWiaMiniDrv::drvGetCapabilities</B></A> method.</P>

<P>The minidriver initiates an event either through the STI event mechanism, or by using <A HREF="wiasfncs_2ckp.htm"><B>wiasQueueEvent</B></A> to add an event notification from this device to the event queue.</P>

<H4>Asynchronous Behavior: Power Management and I/O Cancellation</H4>

<P>In most cases, the WIA service ensures that only one call is made down to the driver at a time. However, some methods are inherently asynchronous and reentrant in nature. A good example of this is the <A HREF="minidrv_41ex.htm"><B>IWiaMiniDrv::drvNotifyPnPEvent</B></A> method.</P>

<P>The WIA service uses this method to notify the driver of events that may require immediate action. For example, when the WIA service receives a Plug and Play event indicating that the device has been removed, it informs the driver immediately. Other examples include power management events and I/O cancellation requests from applications.</P>

<P>For a sample implementation of the <A HREF="minidrv_41ex.htm"><B>IWiaMiniDrv::drvNotifyPnPEvent</B></A> method, illustrating how it should respond to various kinds of events, see <A HREF="wia_db_event_9415.htm">Adding Interrupt Event Support</A>.</P>
