<P>When an object is added or removed, including in response to the <B>StoreAdded</B> or <B>StoreRemoved</B> events (described in the PIMA 15740 standard), a WIA event is triggered. The WIA_EVENT_ITEM_CREATED event is fired when an object is added, and the WIA_EVENT_ITEM_DELETED event is fired when an object is removed. (See the Platform SDK documentation for a description of these and other WIA event identifiers.) The other PTP events are used by the PTP driver to update internal structures, but are not reported to applications. Note that the driver monitors for events only while an application has the device open.</P>
