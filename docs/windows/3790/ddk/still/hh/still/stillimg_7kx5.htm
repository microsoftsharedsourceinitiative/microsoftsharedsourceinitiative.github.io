<P>The imaging architecture in Windows&nbsp;2000 and Windows&nbsp;95/98 consists of a low-level hardware abstraction, STI, and a high-level set of APIs known as TWAIN. In the Windows&nbsp;XP and Windows&nbsp;Me operating system versions, Microsoft introduces Windows Imaging Architecture (WIA), an imaging architecture that builds on STI. </P>

<P><B>Microsoft Imaging Architectures: TWAIN/STI and WIA</B></P>

<P>As shown in the preceding figure, the TWAIN/STI architecture includes TWAIN, a high-level set of image acquisition APIs, together with STI, a low-level hardware abstraction. The WIA architecture incorporates STI as a foundation to provide a complete solution to imaging device IHVs.</P>

<H4>Differences Between STI and WIA</H4>

<UL>
	<LI>A WIA driver builds on the foundation provided by STI and so exposes STI interfaces in addition to its own. At a minimum, a WIA driver must expose <B>IStiUSD</B>. STI has no corresponding dependency on any WIA interface.   </LI>

	<LI>STI runs in both the client application process and the system service process; WIA runs in the system service process only.</LI>

	<LI>STI, being a low-level hardware abstraction, must have detailed information about the device in order to operate; WIA can operate without such detailed device information. </LI>

	<LI>STI is not a complete imaging interface; WIA, which is built on top of STI, is a full solution for imaging IHVs.</LI>
</UL>
