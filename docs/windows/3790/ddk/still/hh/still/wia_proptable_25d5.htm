<P>The WIA_IPA_BUFFER_SIZE property contains the size of the buffer, in bytes, used during a data transfer. An application can read this property to determine the driver-specified buffer size for data transfers. The WIA service also reads this property to allocate memory for the minidriver during the data transfer. The minidriver creates and maintains this property.</P>

<P>Property Type: VT_I4</P>

<P>Valid Values: WIA_PROP_NONE</P>

<P>Access Rights: READONLY</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The value that the WIA_IPA_BUFFER_SIZE property contains is the minimum amount of data an application can request at any given time. The larger the buffer size, the larger the requests to the device will be. This can make the device seem slow and unresponsive, can slow the overall system performance, and can consume excessive resources. Buffer sizes that are too small can slow performance of the data transfer by requiring many smaller requests. Choose a reasonable buffer size by considering the typical size of a data request to your device and balancing the number of requests against the size of those requests.</P>
