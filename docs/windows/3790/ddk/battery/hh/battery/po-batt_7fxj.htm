<P>A battery miniclass driver is responsible for the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Creating an FDO for its devices and storing device-specific information in the associated device extension</LI>

	<LI>Assigning and maintaining the battery tag for the current battery</LI>

	<LI>Keeping track of battery capacity, charge, and power state</LI>

	<LI>Responding to requests from the class driver for battery status information</LI>

	<LI>Notifying the battery class driver when the power state of the battery changes</LI>

	<LI>Charging or discharging a specific battery when requested</LI>
</UL>

<P>A battery miniclass driver calls the battery class driver's support routines for other operations, such as handling IOCTLs, as described in <A HREF="po-batt_3z6v.htm">Battery Class Driver Functionality</A>. </P>

<P>Every battery miniclass driver provides a set of <I>BatteryMiniXxx</I> routines. The battery class driver calls these routines to request that the miniclass driver perform device-specific tasks. In addition, the miniclass driver must have other routines, as described in <A HREF="po-batt_1zs7.htm">Supplying Required Battery Miniclass Driver Functionality</A>.</P>
