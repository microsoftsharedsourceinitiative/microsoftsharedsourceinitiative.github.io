<H1><A NAME="ddk_using_the_ddk_viewer_pg"></A>Using the DDK Viewer</H1>

<P>DDK documentation uses the viewer supplied with Microsoft HTML Help (<I>hh.exe</I>). This viewer provides a table of contents and an index. Additionally, the viewer enables you to search for text strings, print one or several pages, and create subsets that hide topics you don't want to see.</P>

<H4>The Contents Tab</H4>

<P>The <B>Contents</B> tab provides an expandable view of the DDK documentation's table of contents. This view provides a single top node, called "Windows DDK."</P>

<P>The DDK is organized as a set of "books," and clicking the "Windows DDK" node's icon exposes a set of nodes representing these books. Each book contains one of the DDK's major topics.</P>

<P>Most books are divided into "Design Guide" and "Reference" sections.</P>

<P>The icon for each table of contents node is clickable. Some nodes display text when their icons are clicked; others just expand to a set of subnodes, and others do both.</P>

<P>The type of icon displayed for a table of contents node usually does not indicate whether clicking will display text, subnodes, or both.</P>

<H4>The Index Tab</H4>

<P>The <B>Index</B> tab displays the DDK documentation index. This index contains the following:

<UL>
	<LI>The title of every topic contained in the documentation</LI>

	<LI>The name of every function, structure, IRP, IOCTL, or other item for which a "reference" page exists</LI>

	<LI>Every glossary entry</LI>
</UL>

<H4>The Search Tab</H4>

<P>The <B>Search</B> tab gives you the ability to search for any text string contained in the documentation. You can search all text, or limit your search to topic titles. You can search for strings that are exact matches, strings that are similar to a specified string, or strings that are near other strings.</P>

<P>To search for strings of more than one word, enclose the string with quotation marks (<B>"</B>). You can refine your search by using the AND, OR, NOT, and NEAR operators. Use a question mark (<B>?</B>) as a single wildcard character, or an asterisk (<B>*</B>) to represent one or more wildcard characters, anywhere within a non-quoted string.</P>

<H4>The Favorites Tab</H4>

<P>The <B>Favorites</B> Tab lets you save the titles of commonly visited topics. While viewing a topic, select the <B>Favorites</B> tab and click the <B>Add</B> button. Later, you can use the <B>Remove</B> button to remove topics. You can also right-click entries in the <B>Favorites</B> window to rename them.</P>

<H4>Printing Topics</H4>

<P>To print one or more topics, select a topic icon on the <B>Contents</B> tab. Then click the <B>Print</B> button on the taskbar. You will be asked whether you'd like to print just the selected topic, or that topic and all of its subtopics. You can also print the topic you are viewing by right-clicking within the view window, and selecting <B>Print</B>.</P>

<H4>Searching within a Topic</H4>

<P>To search for a text string within the topic you are viewing, press <B>CTRL+F</B>, or select <B>Find in this Topic</B> from the <B>Edit</B> menu.</P>

<H4>Creating Documentation Subsets</H4>

<P>If you don't want to view the entire documentation set, you can create a subset by selecting <B>Define Subset</B> from the <B>View</B> menu. You can select the set of books you'd like the subset to contain, then assign a name to the subset. Then you can select the subset using the <B>Active Subset</B> dropdown list.</P>

<P>After you have selected a subset, only the books in the subset are available when you use the <B>Contents</B>, <B>Index</B>, and <B>Search</B> tabs.</P>
