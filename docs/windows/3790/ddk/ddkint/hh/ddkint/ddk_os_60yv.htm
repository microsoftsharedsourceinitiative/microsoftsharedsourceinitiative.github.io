<P>The Microsoft Windows DDK documentation supports driver development for the following Windows operating systems: 

<UL>
	<LI>Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp; Server 2003 (32-bit and 64-bit environments)</LI>

	<LI>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP (32-bit and 64-bit environments)</LI>

	<LI>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;2000 </LI>

	<LI>Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Windows&nbsp;Me)</LI>
</UL>

<P>Refer to the release notes on the DDK CD-ROM to determine the operating systems for which you can build, debug, and test drivers. The DDK CD-ROM provides different build environments for different operating systems. The release notes describe the supported build environments, and they identify the operating systems that a driver can support if it is built using a particular build environment.</P>

<P>When you install the DDK, you can select which build environments and which sections of the DDK documentation to install, based on the devices and operating systems for which you will be developing drivers.</P>

<P>If you decide, after installing the DDK, that your driver should run on additional operating systems, use the <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> utility in Control Panel to add the build environments for those systems. </P>
