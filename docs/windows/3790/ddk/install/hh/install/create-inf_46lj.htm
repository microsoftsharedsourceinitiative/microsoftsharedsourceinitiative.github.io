<P>Before an application can access the information in an INF file, it must open the file by calling <B>SetupOpenInfFile</B>. This function returns a handle to the INF file. </P>

<P>If you do not know the name of the INF file that you need to open, use <B>SetupGetInfFileList</B> to obtain a list of all the INF files in a directory. </P>

<P>Once an application opens an INF file, it can append additional INF files to the opened file using <B>SetupOpenAppendInfFile</B>. When subsequent Setup functions reference an open INF file, they will also be able to access any information stored in any appended files. </P>

<P>If no INF file is specified when calling <B>SetupOpenAppendInfFile</B>, this function appends the file specified by the <B>LayoutFile</B> entry in the <A HREF="inf-format_2fzm.htm">INF <B>Version </B>section</A> of the INF file opened during the call to <B>SetupOpenInfFile</B>.</P>

<P>When the information in the INF file is no longer needed, the application should call <B>SetupCloseInfFile</B> to release resources allocated during the call to <B>SetupOpenInfFile</B>.</P>
