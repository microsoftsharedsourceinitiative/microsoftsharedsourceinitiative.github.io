<P>The methods you should use to specify source media for device files depend on whether your INFs ship separately from the operating system or are included with the operating system.</P>

<H4>Source Media for INFs that Ship Separately from the Operating System</H4>

<P>INFs for drivers that are delivered separately from the operating system specify where the files are located using <A HREF="inf-format_0icy.htm"><B>SourceDisksNames</B></A> and <A HREF="inf-format_4836.htm"><B>SourceDisksFiles</B></A> sections. If such an INF contains <B>Include</B> and <B>Needs</B> entries in the <A HREF="inf-format_2k8i.htm"><I>DDInstall</I> </A> section, those entries specify additional possible source locations. </P>

<P>If an INF has <B>SourceDisksNames</B> and <B>SourceDisksFiles</B> sections and no <B>Include</B> entries, the <B>SourceDisksNames</B> and <B>SourceDisksFiles</B> sections must list all the source media and source files in the kit except for the catalog and INF files. </P>

<P>Catalog files must be in the same location as the INF file. Catalog files must not be compressed. If the installation media includes multiple disks, then <I>a separate copy of the INF and catalog files must be included on every disk</I>. This is because the INF and catalog files must continue to be accessible throughout the entire installation.</P>

<H4>Source Media for INFs that Ship with the Operating System</H4>

<P>If the files to support the device are included with the operating system, the INF must specify a <B>LayoutFile</B> entry in the <A HREF="inf-format_2fzm.htm"><B>Version</B></A> section of the file. Such an entry specifies where the files reside on the operating system media. An INF that specifies a <B>LayoutFile</B> entry must not include <B>SourceDisksNames</B> and <B>SourceDisksFiles</B> sections. </P>

<P>Only system-supplied INFs should reference <I>layout.inf</I> directly. OEM and IHV INF files that ship with the operating system can reference a common install section in a system-supplied INF (such as <I>mf.inf</I>), and the system-supplied INF references the <I>layout.inf</I> file.</P>

<H4>Source Media and INFs that Contain Include and Needs Entries</H4>

<P>If an INF has <A HREF="inf-format_0icy.htm"><B>SourceDisksNames</B></A> and <A HREF="inf-format_4836.htm"><B>SourceDisksFiles</B></A> sections and <B>Include</B> and <B>Needs</B> entries, Setup uses the main INF file plus any of the included INF files to locate source media. It is especially important with included files to be as precise as possible when specifying source media and source file locations. </P>

<P>Consider the hierarchy of included INFs shown in the following figure. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/inf-hier.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><B>Sample Hierarchy of Included INF Files</B></P>

<P>The figure shows an INF for a multifunction device, named <I>MyMfDevice.inf</I>, which includes the system-supplied <I>mf.inf </I>file. In turn, the system-supplied <I>mf.inf </I>includes the system-supplied<I> layout.inf </I>file. When Setup searches for source media from which to copy a file referenced in <I>MyMfDevice.inf</I>, it looks for a <B>SourceDisksFiles</B> section in <I>MyMfDevice.inf</I> and in any included INF files that reference the file to be copied. Setup searches <I>MyMfDevice.inf</I> first, but it does not guarantee the order in which it searches the included INFs.</P>

<P>Decorated <B>SourceDisksFiles</B> sections take precedence over undecorated sections, even if the <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">decorated INF section</A> is in an included file. For example, for the INFs shown in the previous figure, if <I>layout</I>.<I>inf</I> contains a <B>[SourceDisksFiles.x86] </B>section and <I>MyMfDevice</I>.<I>inf</I> contains only an undecorated <B>[SourceDisksFiles] </B>section, Setup uses the decorated section from <I>layout</I>.<I>inf</I> first when installing on an x86 machine. Therefore, an INF that includes other INFs should contain section names that use platform extensions. </P>

<P>Typically, a vendor-supplied INF should specify the location of the files in its driver package and should not cause Setup to search included INFs for file locations. In other words, a vendor INF that copies files should specify both a <B>SourceDisksNames</B> and a <B>SourceDisksFiles</B> section, those sections should be decorated with platform extensions, and those sections should contain information for all the files directly copied by the INF.</P>

<P>It is helpful if the vendor file names are as vendor-specific as possible, unless the installation is explicitly replacing a vendor-supplied file that shipped with the operating system.</P>

<P>Note the following rules when using <B>Includes</B> and <B>Needs</B> entries:

<UL>
	<LI><B>Includes</B> and <B>Needs</B> entries can only be used to specify system-supplied INF files. </LI>

	<LI><B>Needs</B> entries cannot be nested. That is, a section identified by a <B>Needs</B> entry cannot itself contain a <B>Needs</B> entry.</LI>
</UL>

<P>An INF file that makes use of a section in another INF file by means of the <B>Include</B> and <B>Needs</B> entries might have to make use of an accompanying section to maintain consistency. For instance, if an INF file references the installation section (<I>DDInstall</I>) of another INF file in order to install the driver, it must reference an <A HREF="inf-format_6nle.htm">INF <I>DDInstall</I><B>.Services</B> section</A> to install the accompanying service. Such an INF file might have the following sections:</P>

<PRE>[<I>DDInstall</I>]
Include = AnotherINFFile.inf
Needs = AnotherINFFileDDInstall

[<I>DDInstall</I>.Services]
Include = AnotherINFFile.inf
Needs = AnotherINFFileDDInstall.Services</PRE>
