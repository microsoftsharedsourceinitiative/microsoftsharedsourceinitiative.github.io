<P>You should only create a new device setup class if absolutely necessary. It is usually possible to assign your device to one of the <A HREF="setup-cls_2i1z.htm">system-supplied device setup classes</A>.</P>

<P>If your device meets both of the following criteria, you should assign it to an existing device setup class:

<UL>
	<LI>Your device's installation and configuration requirements match those of an existing class.</LI>

	<LI>Your device's capabilities match those of an existing class.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Under the either of following circumstances, you should consider providing a device co-installer:

<UL>
	<LI>Your device has installation requirements that are not supported by an existing device type-specific INF file.</LI>

	<LI>Installation of your device requires device property pages that are not provided by an existing class.</LI>
</UL>

<P>If your device provides capabilities that are significantly different from the capabilities provided by devices that belong to existing classes, it might merit a new device setup class. However, you must never create a new setup class for a device that belongs to one of the system-supplied classes. If you do, you will bypass the system-supplied class installer and your device will not be properly integrated into the system.</P>

<P>If you think a new device setup class is needed, your new class should be based on new device capabilities, and not on the device's location. For instance, supporting an existing device on a new bus should not require a new setup class.</P>

<P>Before creating a new device setup class, contact Microsoft to find out if a new system-supplied device setup class is being planned for your device type</P>

<P>You can create a new device setup class using an INF file. Besides installing support for a device, an INF file can initialize a new device setup class for the device. Such an INF file has an <A HREF="inf-format_6p9u.htm">INF <B>ClassInstall32</B> section</A>.</P>
