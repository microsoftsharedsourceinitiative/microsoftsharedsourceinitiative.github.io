<P>The following example shows selected fragments from a system-supplied class installer's INF file to illustrate how any INF file is made up of sections, each containing zero or more lines, some of which are entries that reference additional INF-writer-defined sections: </P>

<P>A few sections within the preceding INF file have system-defined names, such as <B>Version</B>, <B>DestinationDirs</B>, <B>Manufacturer</B>, and <B>Strings</B>. Some named sections like <B>Version</B>, <B>DestinationDirs</B>, and <B>Strings</B> have only simple entries. Others reference additional INF-writer-defined sections, as shown in the preceding example of the <B>Manufacturer</B> section. </P>

<P>Note the implied hierarchy of related sections for mouse device driver installations starting with the <B>Manufacturer</B> section in the preceding example. The following figure shows the hierarchy of some of the sections in the INF file. </P>

<P><B>Sample Hierarchy of Sections in an INF File</B></P>

<P>Note the following about the implied hierarchy of an INF file:

<UL>
	<LI>Each <B>%</B><I>xx</I>Mfg<B>%</B> entry in the <B>Manufacturer</B> section references a per-manufacturer <I>Models</I> section (StdMfg, MSMfg) elsewhere in the INF file. (The entries in the example above use %<I>strkey</I>% tokens.) </LI>

	<LI>Each <I>Models</I> section specifies some number of entries; in the example they are <B>%</B><I>xxx</I>.DeviceDesc<B>%</B> tokens. 
<P>Each such <B>%</B><I>xxx</I>.DeviceDesc<B>%</B> token references some number of per-models <I>DDInstall</I> sections (Ser_Inst and Inp_Inst) for that manufacturer's product line, with each entry identifying a single device (*PNP0F0C and *PNP0F0D, hence the "DeviceDesc" shown here) or a set of compatible models of a device.
</LI>

	<LI>Each such <I>DDInstall</I>-type <I>Xxx</I>_Inst section, in turn, can have certain system-defined extensions appended and/or can contain directives that reference additional INF-writer-defined sections. For instance, the full INF file shown as fragments in the preceding example also has a Ser_Inst<B>.Services</B> section, and its Ser_Inst section has a <B>CopyFiles</B> directive that references a Ser_CopyFiles section elsewhere in this INF file.</LI>
