<P>An INF file specifies the target location for device files with a <A HREF="inf-format_8kfm.htm"><B>DestinationDirs</B></A> section. This section should always be specified in the same INF file as the section with the copy, rename, or delete statements. </P>

<P>A <B>DestinationDirs</B> section should include a <B>DefaultDestDir</B> entry. </P>

<P>If an INF has copy, rename, or delete sections but no <B>DestinationDirs</B> section and the INF includes other INFs, Setup searches the included INFs for target location information. However, the order in which Setup searches the included files is not predictable. Therefore, there is a risk that Setup will, for example, copy files to a location not intended by the INF writer. To avoid such confusion, always specify a <B>DestinationDirs</B> section in an INF that contains copy, rename, or delete sections. The <B>DestinationDirs</B> section should include at least a <B>DefaultDestDir</B> entry and can list sections in the INF that copy, rename, or delete files.</P>
