<P>By using system-defined extensions to <A HREF="inf-format_7soi.htm">INF file sections and directives</A>, you can create a single INF file for cross-platform installations and/or for dual-OS installations. The extensions enable you to create <I>decorated </I>section names. For <A HREF="inf-format_2k8i.htm">INF <I>DDInstall</I> sections</A> and related directives, these <I>decorations</I> (<B>.ntx86</B>, <B>.ntia64</B>, or <B>.nt</B>) specify which sections and directives are relevant to each platform and operating system. You can create an INF file that installs a device only on x86 platforms, only on ia64 platforms, on all platforms supported by Windows&nbsp;NT4.0 and later, on all platforms supported by Windows 9x/Me, or on all platforms for all operating systems.</P>

<P>For example, if your device supports Windows&nbsp;2000 and later platforms, and Windows&nbsp;9x/Me platforms, you would create an INF file with two or more "parallel" <I>DDInstall</I> sections that have the following extensions to control what is installed on each platform and/or for each operating system:

<UL>
	<LI>The <B>[</B><I>install-section-name</I><B>.ntx86]</B> extension contains instructions for installing the device or set of device-compatible models on all Windows&nbsp;NT4.0 and later x86-based platforms.</LI>

	<LI>The <B>[</B><I>install-section-name</I><B>.ntia64]</B> extension contains instructions for installing the device or set of device-compatible models on all ia64-based platforms.</LI>

	<LI>The <B>[</B><I>install-section-name</I><B>.nt]</B> extension contains instructions for installing the device or set of device-compatible models on all Windows&nbsp;NT4.0 and later platforms. </LI>

	<LI>The <B>[</B><I>install-section-name</I><B>]</B> extension contains Windows&nbsp;9x/Me-specific instructions. 
<P>Undecorated sections are also fallback sections for Windows&nbsp;NT4.0 and later platforms. Setup uses undecorated sections on Windows&nbsp;NT4.0 and later platforms if it cannot locate the appropriate decorated sections. However, to prevent these sections from being used on Windows&nbsp;9x/Me by mistake, you should decorate any Windows&nbsp;NT4.0-specific or later <I>DDInstall</I> and related sections with the <B>.ntx86</B>, <B>.ntia64</B>, or <B>.nt</B> extensions.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>Windows Setup processes these <I>DDInstall</I> sections as follows:

<UL>
	<LI>On Windows 9x/Me, Setup processes the undecorated section and ignores any sections with <B>.nt*</B> platform extensions.</LI>

	<LI>On Windows&nbsp;NT4.0 and later:
<OL>
	<LI>Setup checks for install sections with the platform-specific extensions, such as <B>.ntx86</B>. If one is present, Setup processes the section appropriate for the current platform. Setup checks for platform-specific install sections in the INF being processed and in any included INF files (that is, any INFs included with <B>Include</B> entries). </LI>

	<LI>If there are no specific platform extensions, Setup checks for a <I>install-section-name</I><B>.nt</B> section in the INF or any included INFs. If one is present, Setup processes the <I>install-section-name</I><B>.nt</B> section.</LI>

	<LI>If there is no <I>install-section-name</I><B>.nt</B> section, Setup processes the undecorated section.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>An INF file containing  INF <I>DDInstall</I> sections with platform extensions can also contain additional per-device sections,such as the required <I>DDInstall</I><B>.Services</B> and optional <I>DDInstall</I><B>.HW</B>, <I>DDInstall</I><B>.CoInstallers</B>, <I>DDInstall</I><B>.LogConfigOverride</B>, and/or <I>DDInstall</I>.<B>Interfaces</B> sections. In dual-OS and/or cross-platform INF files, you should specify the appropriate extension immediately following the INF-writer-defined section name as, for example, <I>install-section-name</I><B>.ntx86.HW</B>. </P>

<P>If a dual-OS INF file contains decorated <I>install-section-name</I><B>.nt</B>, <I>install-section-name</I><B>.ntx86</B>, or <I>install-section-name</I><B>.ntia64</B> sections, it must also have additional parallel decorated and undecorated per-device sections. That is, if the INF file has both <I>install-section-name</I> and <I>install-section-name</I><B>.nt</B> sections and it has a <I>DDInstall</I>.<B>HW</B> section, it also must have a parallel <I>install-section-name</I><B>.nt.HW</B> section (if the device or driver requires a <B>.HW</B> section for Windows&nbsp;NT4.0 and later).</P>

<P>The <A HREF="inf-format_7soi.htm">INF File Sections and Directives</A> documentation shows these extensions as part of the formal syntax statements in the appropriate section references as, for example:</P>

<P class=indent1><B>[</B><I>install-section-name</I><B>.HW]</B> | <BR>
<B>[</B><I>install-section-name</I><B>.nt.HW]</B> | <BR>
<B>[</B><I>install-section-name</I><B>.ntx86.HW]</B> | <BR>
<B>[</B><I>install-section-name</I><B>.ntia64.HW]</B> </P>

<P>Such a formal syntax statement indicates that these extensions are valid alternatives to the basic section. It does <I>not</I> indicate that any INF with a <I>install-section-name</I><B>.nt.HW</B> section must also have every other platform-specific <I>install-section-name</I><B>.nt</B><I>xxx</I><B>.HW</B> section. You can use any subset of these extensions to specify the decorated sections required for a particular cross-platform or dual-OS installation. </P>

<P>INF files that contain <I>install-section-name</I> platform extensions can also include platform extensions with their <A HREF="inf-format_0icy.htm">INF <B>SourceDisksNames</B> section</A> and <A HREF="inf-format_4836.htm">INF <B>SourceDisksFiles</B> section</A> entries, to specify installation file locations in a platform-specific manner.</P>

<P>For Windows XP and later, you can supply INF <I>Models</I> sections that are specific to various versions of the operating system. These version-specific <I>Models</I> sections are identified using the <I>TargetOSVersion</I> decoration in an <A HREF="inf-format_816a.htm">INF <B>Manufacturer</B> section</A>.</P>
