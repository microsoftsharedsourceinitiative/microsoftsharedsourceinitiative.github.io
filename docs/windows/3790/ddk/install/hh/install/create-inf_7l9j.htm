<H1><A NAME="ddk_creating_international_inf_files_dg"></A>Creating International INF Files</H1>

<P>Creating installations for international markets requires providing locale-specific INF files and, possibly, locale-specific driver files.</P>

<P>An INF file that will be used in an international market should use <B>%</B><I>strkey</I><B>%</B> tokens for all user-viewable text. The strings are defined in an INF <B>Strings</B> section, which is typically at the end of the INF file. </P>

<H4>Locale-Specific INF Files</H4>

<P>You can create a single INF file that supports several locales, or you can create a separate INF file for each locale.

<UL>
	<LI>To create a single international INF file, you should include a set of locale-specific <B>Strings.</B><I>LanguageID</I> sections, as described in the reference page for the <A HREF="inf-format_3uuq.htm">INF <B>Strings</B> section</A>. Use this technique if you intend to supply a single installation medium for all international markets. 
<P>For installations on NT-based operating systems, this is the recommended method for supporting international markets.
</LI>

	<LI>To create a separate INF file for each locale, start with a main INF file containing all the necessary sections and entries, except for the <B>Strings</B> section. Then create a second set of files, where each file contains just the <B>Strings</B> section for a supported locale. Concatenate the main file with each strings file to generate the locale-specific INF files. 
<P>For installations on Windows 9x/Me, this is the recommended method for supporting international markets, because Windows 9x/Me does not support <B>Strings</B>.<I>LanguageID</I> sections.

<P>For installations on NT-based operating systems, use this technique <I>only</I> if you intend to supply a separate installation medium for each international market. You cannot provide multiple versions of an INF file, for a particular NT-based OS version, on a single installation medium because Setup cannot determine which INF file to use. 
</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Locale-Specific Versions of Driver Files</H4>

<P>If you need to provide locale-specific versions of driver files for NT-based operating systems, mark each version of each file with its locale. Be sure to mark files that are not locale-specific as language-neutral. You can do this by adding the following macro definition to your resource file:</P>

<PRE>#define VER_LANGNEUTRAL
</PRE>

<P>This definition must appear before the preprocessor directive that includes <I>common.ver</I>. </P>

<P>After compiling your files, you can verify that each is marked as language-neutral by:

<OL>
	<LI>Right-clicking on the file in Windows Explorer.</LI>

	<LI>Clicking <B>Properties</B>.</LI>

	<LI>Clicking the <B>Version</B> tab.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The <B>Language</B> selection in the <B>Other version information</B> pane contains a value that identifies the file as Language Neutral, or as intended for a specific locale.</P>

<P>Place the locale-specific files in separate, locale-specific subdirectories of the distribution medium, such as /<I>English</I> and /<I>German</I>. In your INF file, do the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Within the <A HREF="inf-format_4836.htm">INF <B>SourceDisksFiles</B> section</A>, specify locale-specific subdirectories by using a string key token such as <B>%LocaleSubDir%</B>.</LI>

	<LI>Provide separate <A HREF="inf-format_3uuq.htm">INF <B>Strings</B> sections</A> for each language, and define the appropriate subdirectory name string in each section.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For example:</P>

<PRE>[SourceDisksNames]
1=%DiskName%,,,%LocaleSubDir%

[SourceDisksFiles]
mysftwre.exe=1

[Strings]              ; No language ID implies English
DiskName="My Excellent Software"
LocaleSubDir="English"
[Strings.0407]         ; 0407 is the language ID for German
DiskName="Meine ausgezeichnete Software"
LocaleSubDir="German"
</PRE>

<P>For information about how to organize distribution media with locale-specific INF files, see <A HREF="install-over_0b1j.htm">Creating Directories for Driver Distribution Media</A>.</P>

<H4>Creating Unicode INF Files</H4>

<P>If an INF file contains characters that fall outside the ASCII range (that is, outside the range of 0-127), the INF file should be in Unicode format. One way to create a Unicode INF file is to use an application such as Notepad to save it in Unicode format. If the INF is not in Unicode format, Setup uses the current locale to translate characters. If the INF file is in Unicode format, Setup uses the full Unicode character set. Some applications, such as Notepad, allow you to create a Unicode file in either little-endian or big-endian format. Setup supports INF files that use either format. (Windows 9x/Me Setup ignores Unicode-formatted INF files.)</P>
