<P>Video port child devices (such as TVTuner and display combination adapters) can block power state transitions when the driver is in use. The power state transition blocking occurs when the device driver is actively in use (pins or filters are open). If the driver is loaded but has no pins or filters in use, power state transitions from S0 (fully powered) to lower power states (S1, S2, S3 and S4) will occur normally. This issue only occurs with streaming class drivers that are clients of video port child devices.</P>

<P>A WHQL waiver is available for devices that meet this criteria, so a logo may still be obtained.</P>
