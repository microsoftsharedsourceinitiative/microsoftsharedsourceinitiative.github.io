<P>PCI capture devices with TV/radio tuners, TV audio and crossbars are often capable of bus mastering separate preview and capture streams, each with a potentially different color space and frame dimensions. Such devices can also provide separate streams for vertical blanking interval (VBI) or timecode. The following illustration shows separate renderers connected to the preview and capture streams.</P>

<P><B>TV/radio Tuner/Capture Card Filter Graph</B></P>

<P>The <A HREF="vidcapref_1gz7.htm">PROPSETID_ALLOCATOR_CONTROL</A> property set is unique to this type of graph.</P>

<P>An optional variation for this type of graph is to connect the Preview pin to the Video Mixer/Render (VMR) filter instead of the standard video renderer by using the <A HREF="vidcapref_30ab.htm">KS_VIDEOINFOHEADER2</A> structure format. When configured in this mode with a display device that supports the Video Port Manager (VPM) and Video Port Extensions (VPEs) Kernel Mode Video Transport, buffers are passed to the capture device along with the Microsoft® DirectDraw® surface handles in the <A HREF="vidcapref_1rg3.htm">KS_FRAME_INFO</A> structure. </P>

<P>The capture minidriver then can retain ownership of the buffers indefinitely--locking, filling, unlocking, and flipping the surfaces as they are captured. The capture driver must register for notifications that indicate loss of surfaces while running full screen MS-DOS applications or exclusive-mode games. In these cases, complete the buffers back to the capture filter.</P>

<P>For devices with FM tuners, minidrivers should support KS_TUNER_STRATEGY_PLL (specified in <A HREF="vidcapref_271v.htm">KSPROPERTY_TUNER_MODE_CAPS_S</A>). In addition, the SignalStrength member of KSPROPERTY_TUNER_STATUS_S should be set to -1, 0 or 1, depending on whether an "acceptable" frequency is currently selected (see <A HREF="vidcapref_3zub.htm">KSPROPERTY_TUNER_STATUS_S</A> for details). Unfortunately, there is no strict guideline for what "acceptable" means, the decision being left to the vendor as to what RSSI (Receiver Signal Strength Indicator) or dbmV above or below the baseline voltage constitutes an acceptable signal for FM reception.</P>

<P>If the FM tuner does not natively support KS_TUNER_STRATEGY_PLL (see <A HREF="vidcapref_271v.htm">KSPROPERTY_TUNER_MODE_CAPS_S</A>), the minidriver should fake this support based on the native signal strength indicator (the FM fine-tuning function of <I>kstvtune.ax </I>will only be enabled if the driver reports KS_TUNER_STRATEGY_PLL).</P>

<P>Another option is to specify KS_TUNER_STRATEGY_DRIVER_TUNES, and push all of the fine-tuning logic into the minidriver. However, if the minidriver specifies KS_TUNER_STRATEGY_SIGNAL_STRENGTH, <I>kstvtune.ax</I> will still attempt to use the PLLOffset member of the KSPROPERTY_TUNER_STATUS_S structure, so this is not a valid option for future compatibility.</P>
