<P>Some GFX filters, especially those that are designed to process signals for specific hardware, might need to know which device they are producing data for (in the case of a rendering GFX filter) or receiving data from (in the case of a capture GFX filter). For example, a filter may need to alter its signal processing algorithm to accommodate different members of a family of related devices.</P>

<P>Just after instantiating a GFX filter, but before restoring the filter's persistent properties, the operating system sets a property called <A HREF="aud-prop_6boz.htm">KSPROPERTY_AUDIOGFX_RENDERTARGETDEVICEID</A> or <A HREF="aud-prop_2dv7.htm">KSPROPERTY_AUDIOGFX_CAPTURETARGETDEVICEID</A> (for render or capture GFX filters, respectively) to inform the GFX of the PnP device ID of the rendering or capture device. The format of the property data for KSPROPERTY_AUDIOGFX_<I>XXX</I>TARGETDEVICEID is a NULL-terminated Unicode string.</P>

<P>If a GFX filter detects that the user has connected it to a rendering or capture device that it does not support (for example, a device made by another vendor), the GFX can choose not to perform global-effects processing on that device's stream. In this case, however, the GFX should simply pass the stream through unchanged. Under no circumstances should the GFX attempt to block or degrade the stream.</P>
