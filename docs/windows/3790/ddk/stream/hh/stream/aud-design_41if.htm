<P>Data ranges are used not only for data intersection, but can be accessed as device properties as well (see <A HREF="aud-design_410n.htm">Pin Data-Range and Intersection Properties</A>). For this reason, an adapter driver whose data-intersection handler takes care of all format negotiations on its pins should still include a complete set of data ranges. The data ranges should reflect as closely as possible the data-format preferences that are embodied in the adapter's data-intersection handler.</P>

<P>A pin's data ranges can be accessed through the following properties:</P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="ks-prop_32r7.htm">KSPROPERTY_PIN_DATARANGES</A></P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="ks-prop_541f.htm">KSPROPERTY_PIN_CONSTRAINEDDATARANGES</A></P>

<P>These two properties designate the pin's static data ranges and constrained data ranges, respectively.</P>

<P>Constrained data ranges provide more accurate information on the current capabilities of a device because they are dynamically updated to account for any on-board resources that have already been allocated for other purposes. By comparison, static data ranges might inaccurately report hardware capabilities that depend on resources that are no longer available.</P>

<P>In the current PortCls implementation, the default data-intersection handlers in the port drivers use only an adapter's static data ranges.</P>
