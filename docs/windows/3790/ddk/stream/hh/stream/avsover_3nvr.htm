<P>The DDK includes two sample AVStream minidrivers: <I>Avshws</I> and <I>Avssamp</I>. <I>Avshws</I> is a pin-centric capture driver for a simulated piece of hardware. <I>Avshws</I> also shows how to implement DMA through AVStream. <I>Avssamp</I> is a filter-centric capture driver that does not perform DMA.</P>

<P>These samples demonstrate many of the concepts that are described in this documentation. These sample drivers can be tailored to a driver developer's needs. Readmes corresponding to these samples can be found in the DDK, located in the same directories as the samples. These readmes are not included in the DDK documentation.</P>
