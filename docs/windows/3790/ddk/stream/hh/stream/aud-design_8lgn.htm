<P>If your multifunction audio device contains game ports, note that the adapter driver's handling of the game ports on Windows&nbsp;2000 and later differs from that on Windows&nbsp;98/Me. In contrast, all three operating systems are consistent in their use of WDM audio drivers. On Windows&nbsp;98/Me, the joystick portion of the operating system is still VxD-based and you must write a hybrid VxD-WDM adapter driver. This is unnecessary on Windows&nbsp;2000 and later, which support joysticks with a DirectInput HID driver.</P>

<P>If your game port requires Type-F DMA transfers, note that these are supported on Windows&nbsp;98/Me, but not on Windows&nbsp;2000 and later. The <I>PC 2001 System Design Guide </I>does not require support for legacy game ports on new PCs, which are likely to use USB joystick devices instead.</P>

<P>A limitation in Windows&nbsp;98 prevents loading a child VxD from a WDM parent. This can cause problems with a multifunction device that combines a joystick, which requires a VxD on Windows&nbsp;98, with an audio device that has a WDM parent. This limitation has been removed in Windows&nbsp;98&nbsp;SE and Windows&nbsp;Me.</P>
