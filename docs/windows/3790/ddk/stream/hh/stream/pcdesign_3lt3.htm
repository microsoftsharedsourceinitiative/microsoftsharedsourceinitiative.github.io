<P>The WDM audio system provides driver support for application programs that access audio devices through the DirectSound API. For a description of the system components that provide DirectSound driver support, see <A HREF="aud-design_2v53.htm">WDM Audio Components</A>.</P>

<P>The following section discusses the features that audio miniport drivers can implement to better support the audio capabilities that the DirectSound API exposes to application programs. These capabilities include hardware acceleration of 2D and 3D sound effects, support for a variety of speaker configurations, and capture effects such as acoustic echo cancellation for full-duplex telephone conferencing.</P>
