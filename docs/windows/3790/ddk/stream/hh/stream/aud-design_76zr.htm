<P>This section describes the following topics about the algorithm that the KMixer system driver uses to minimize SRC (sample-rate conversion) and mixing:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>When the <A HREF="aud-design_1kiv.htm#ddk_sysaudio_system_driver_ksg">SysAudio system driver</A> initializes the KMixer driver for an audio device, it assigns a sample rate corresponding to the higher of 44.1 kHz and the highest rate available on the audio device. (In Windows&nbsp;XP&nbsp;SP1, Windows&nbsp;Server 2003, and later, the highest sample rate that KMixer supports is 200&nbsp;kHz. In Windows&nbsp;98/Me, Windows&nbsp;2000, and Windows&nbsp;XP, KMixer's highest sample rate is 100 kHz.) Note that the miniport driver's request handler returns the sample rates available on the device (see <A HREF="aud-design_410n.htm">Pin Data-Range and Intersection Properties</A>).</LI>

	<LI>When a client requests connection of an audio stream to a device, KMixer queries the device to determine whether it supports the incoming rate. If the device supports the incoming rate, KMixer passes the incoming stream to the device without SRC. Otherwise, KMixer maintains the current output rate, and does the following:
<UL>
	<LI>If the device supports the current output rate, KMixer uses SRC to convert the input rate to the current output rate.</LI>

	<LI>If the device does not support the current output rate, KMixer maintains the current rate and fails the client's request to connect the audio stream to the device.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>

<P>The following summarizes the policy on rate conversion and mixing for input streams that clients attempt to connect after connecting the first input stream (in the order in which KMixer applies the tests):</P>

	<LI>KMixer does not adjust its output rate when a client makes an <B>IDirectSoundBuffer::SetFrequency</B> call on a DirectSound buffer. Instead, KMixer adjusts the output rate when the buffer is first played.</LI>

	<LI>The Sound Blaster emulator (<A HREF="aud-design_1kiv.htm#ddk_sbemul_system_driver_ksg">SBEMul system driver</A>) performs dynamic adjustments to its sample rate. KMixer maintains an output rate greater than or equal to that of the Sound Blaster emulator.</LI>
