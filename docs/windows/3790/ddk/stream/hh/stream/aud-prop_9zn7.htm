<H1><A NAME="ddk_setuppreferredaudiodevices_ks"></A>SetupPreferredAudioDevices</H1>

<P>The <B>SetupPreferredAudioDevices</B> keyword denotes the preferred audio device, which is the device that the audio system enables by default when the system contains one or more audio devices. This keyword is media-class specific and is supported by Windows&nbsp;98/Me, and Windows&nbsp;2000 and later.</P>

<P>When creating an audio device, an application program can elect to use the default (or preferred) device instead of explicitly specifying a device. (For example, see the descriptions of the <B>waveOutOpen</B> and <B>DirectSoundCreate</B> functions in the Platform SDK documentation.)</P>

<P>The audio system keeps track of the current preferred audio device in the system registry. When a user upgrades a system by installing a new audio device, the proprietary INF file that installs the device typically updates the registry to designate the new device as the preferred audio device.</P>

<P>The <B>SetupPreferredAudioDevices</B> keyword can appear within a registry-update directive in the <I>add-registry-section</I> (see <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">INF <I>AddReg</I> Directive</A>) of an INF file for an audio device. This directive has the following format:</P>

<P class=indent1><I>reg-rootkey</I><B>,</B> [<I>reg-subkey</I>]<B>,</B> <B>SetupPreferredAudioDevices,</B> [<I>flags</I>]<B>,</B> [<I>dword-value</I>] </P>

<P>The directive instructs the audio system to use the device's audio functions as the defaults for sound playback, sound recording, and MIDI music playback. Following installation, these three defaults appear in the <B>Sounds and Multimedia</B> control panel under the <B>Audio</B> tab. The user can use Control Panel to change the default devices.</P>

<P>The directive's <I>dword-value</I> parameter specifies a DWORD value that should be nonzero in order to enable the directive. If this value is zero, the directive has no effect. Because Windows&nbsp;98/Me do not support the REG_DWORD registry data type, however, <I>dword-value </I>is typically expressed as a 4-byte REG_BINARY type instead of as a DWORD (for example, as "01,00,00,00" instead of "0x00000001"). The <I>dword-value</I> parameter can be specified in raw binary format by setting the directive's <I>flags</I> parameter to "1" (FLG_ADDREG_BINVALUETYPE).</P>

<P>The directive takes effect at the time that the driver for the device is installed. If another device occupies the role of preferred device at the time that the new device is installed, the directive causes the new device to assume the role of preferred device, thus displacing the other device from this role.</P>

<P>When upgrading or reinstalling the driver for a device that has already been installed, you may want to avoid altering the user's current preferred-device selections for sound playback, sound recording, and MIDI music playback. If so, set the FLG_ADDREG_NOCLOBBER bit in the <I>flags</I> parameter, which causes the directive to take effect only if this is the device's initial installation.</P>

<H4>Example</H4>

<P>The following example is a fragment of an INF file that shows how to use the <B>SetupPreferredAudioDevices</B> keyword:</P>

<PRE>  AddReg = XYZ-Audio-Device.AddReg
  ...
  [XYZ-Audio-Device.AddReg]
  HKR,,SetupPreferredAudioDevices,3,01,00,00,00</PRE>

<P>The directive at the end of the example specifies that the device named "XYZ-Audio-Device" is now the preferred audio device. HKR is the audio device's root key in the registry. The <I>flags</I> parameter is set to 3, which is the bitwise OR of FLG_ADDREG_BINVALUETYPE and FLG_ADDREG_NOCLOBBER. The latter prevents the device's existing preferred-device registry entries from getting overwritten in the event that the device is already installed and its driver is merely being upgraded. The four bytes at the end of the directive specify a nonzero value, which is necessary to enable the directive.</P>
