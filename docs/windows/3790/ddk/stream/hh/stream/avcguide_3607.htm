<P>As AV/C devices are added and removed from the 1394 bus, drivers are loaded and unloaded by the Plug and Play Manager. The following diagram shows the driver stack.</P>

<P><B>Peer AV/C Device Stack</B></P>

<P>At the bottom of the stack are <I>1394ohci.sys</I> and <I>1394bus.sys</I>. These drivers provide the basic 1394 infrastructure support. There are instances of these drivers for each 1394 adapter in the system.</P>

<P>Next in the stack is <I>61883.sys</I>. This protocol driver provides the IEEE 61883-1 connection management protocol (CMP), common isochronous packet (CIP), and function control protocol (FCP) support, as well as PnP enumeration of devices for each command transaction set (CTS). There is an instance of this driver for each 61883-enabled node on the 1394 bus.</P>

<P>Next in the stack is <I>avc.sys</I>. This driver provides AV/C protocol support, PnP enumeration of devices for each AV/C subunit, and plug connection management and control.</P>

<P>Next in the stack are the subunit drivers. This is the level where all of the unique AV/C subunit functionality is implemented. There is generally an instance of a particular subunit driver for each subunit type and ID within that type.</P>

<P>For more information about the mechanism for subunit enumeration and the format of the device IDs associated with an AV/C device, see <A HREF="avcguide_2so7.htm">Peer Subunit Enumeration</A>.</P>
