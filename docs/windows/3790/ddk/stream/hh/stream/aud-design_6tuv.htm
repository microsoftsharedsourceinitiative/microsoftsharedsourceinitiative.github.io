<P>This section describes the sample-rate conversion and mixing policy of the <A HREF="aud-design_1kiv.htm#ddk_kmixer_system_driver_ksg">KMixer system driver</A>. KMixer is the kernel-mode system component that performs mixing of KS (kernel-streaming) audio streams.</P>

<P>KMixer can mix playback audio streams from clients such as DirectSound® or <B>waveOut</B> application programs. The streams can be in different wave PCM formats with a variety of sample rates, sample sizes, and channel counts. Samples can be expressed as integer or floating-point values. KMixer generates a mixed stream in a format that the downstream filter, which is typically an audio rendering device, can handle.</P>

<P>KMixer can also perform format conversion (but no mixing) of a capture stream. KMixer inputs the capture stream from an audio capture device and converts it to a format that a client such as a DirectSoundCapture or <B>waveIn</B> application program can handle.</P>
