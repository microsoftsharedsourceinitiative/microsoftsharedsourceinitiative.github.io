<P><I>Blacklisting</I> and <I>Delayed</I> are response characteristics. Blacklisting occurs when the modem does not dial because there have been too many unsuccessful attempts. A delayed state occurs when the modem does not dial, until some time has elapsed, because there have been too many recent unsuccessful attempts. </P>

<P>Two codes in the <B>bResponseState</B> field of a <A HREF="modemref1_90vm.htm"><B>Responses</B></A> entry correspond to the Delayed and Blacklisting characteristics. For more information on the <B>bResponseState</B> settings in the <B>Responses</B> entries, see <A HREF="modemref1_6n8y.htm">Data Modem INF File Entries</A>.
