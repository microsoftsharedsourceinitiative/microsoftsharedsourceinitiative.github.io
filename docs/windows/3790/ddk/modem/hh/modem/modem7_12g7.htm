<P>You can use the NDIS Test, which is part of the HCT Kit,  to verify that your modem INF file properly installs and runs with your modem on a Windows platform. After successfully completing the pre-test of the modem and INF file with the NDIS Test kit, follow the directions that are outlined in the NDIS Test kit to submit the INF file and modem hardware to Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL). </P>

<P>Use the current version of the HCT  for WHQL submissions. The MCT has been replaced by NDIS Test. Parts of the MCT could be obsolete or preliminary versions provided only to test new system features. For more information about WHQL submissions, see <A HREF="modem7_0rdz.htm">WHQL Testing for Modems</A>. NDIS Test is updated frequently to support the latest features. Instructions on how to run the current version of NDIS Test can be obtained from WHQL.</P>

<P>Microsoft often receives requests to add additional features to the NDIS Test. Generally it is updated only to implement a significant feature change. Submit your requests for new features to WHQL.</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice modem support for caller ID should be tested with NDIS Test.</P>
