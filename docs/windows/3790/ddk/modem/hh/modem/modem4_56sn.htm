<P>The adaptive answering algorithm is implemented in the Microsoft T.30 protocol engine. This algorithm provides for the auto-detection of data and fax calls using a fax modem.</P>

<P class=proch><B><IMG SRC="../images/wedge.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>The adaptive answering algorithm proceeds as follows</B>

<OL>
	<LI>A call to the modem is initiated.</LI>

	<LI>The modem sends "RING" strings to the system.</LI>

	<LI>TAPI gets "RING" events and passes them to T.30.</LI>

	<LI>T.30 starts answering the incoming call.</LI>

	<LI>If there is a <B>Fax\Class1\AdaptiveAnswer</B> registry key, the following procedure will be executed:
<OL>
	<LI>T.30 configures the DTE-DCE baud rate and flow control using either the registry settings (installed from the INF file), or the default settings (19200 Kbps, software flow control).</LI>

	<LI>T.30 sends the ResetCommand string to the modem.</LI>

	<LI>T.30 sends the SetupCommand string to the modem.</LI>

	<LI>T.30 sends a group of <B>Fax\Class1\AdaptiveAnswer\AnswerCommand</B> strings to the modem.</LI>

	<LI>T.30 receives the <B>ModemResponseFaxDetect</B> string if the modem detected a fax call, or, T.30 receives the <B>ModemResponseDataDetect</B> string if the modem detected a data call.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>

	<LI>At this point in the process, the incoming call type has been detected. Some modems will change the modem-to-host baud rate, while other modems need to be instructed explicitly to go online. The following INF file entries are defined to control this behavior:
<UL>
	<LI><B>SerialSpeedFaxDetect </B>requires the system to switch to the specified DTE-DCE speed immediately after an incoming call has been identified as a fax call.</LI>

	<LI><B>SerialSpeedDataDetect </B>requires the system to switch to the specified DTE-DCE speed immediately after an incoming call has been identified as a data call.</LI>

	<LI><B>HostCommandFaxDetectOptional </B>requires the system to connect to a remote modem after an incoming call has been identified as a fax call. </LI>

	<LI><B>HostCommandDataDetect </B>requires the system to connect to a remote modem after an incoming call has been identified as a data call. </LI>
</UL>
</LI>

	<LI>T.30 expects a connect string after the local fax-modem is connected to a remote fax-modem. Connect strings for data or fax calls are defined by:
<UL>
	<LI><B>ModemResponseFaxConnect,</B> which indicates a fax connection.</LI>

	<LI><B>ModemResponseDataConnect,</B> which indicates a data connection.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>

	<LI>For a fax call, T.30 continues handling this call. For a data call, T.30 hands the call off to the appropriately TAPI-registered DATA application (for example, RAS).</LI>
</OL>
