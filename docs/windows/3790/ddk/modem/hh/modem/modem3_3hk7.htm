<P>Unimodem supports the dynamic configuration of GSM modems. The registry entries discussed in this section support connection-by-connection selection of the radio link protocols and end-to-end protocols.</P>

<P>GSM-specific entries are preceded by <B>Protocol\GSM\</B>, which places them in the appropriate registry subfolder.</P>

<P>A limited range of additional entries are provided to support high-speed, circuit-switched data (HSCSD), as documented in ETSI 07.07, in order to support the configuration of faster data connections using emerging GSM technology.</P>

<P>There is no entry for GSM modems that is equivalent to the <A HREF="modemref1_50du.htm"><B>Properties</B></A> entry for PSTN (analog) modems. GSM modem properties are set through separate INF file entries. The presence of the GSM-related entries in the INF file activates the associated portions of the user interface and identifies the protocols that the GSM modem supports for TAPI.</P>

<P>GSM supports a large number of logical protocols. The three major protocol classes include:

<DL>
<DT><B>Analog</B></DT>

<DD>Connects to a remote PSTN voice band modem using another modem in a modem pool in the GSM network provider facilities, for example V.90, V.34, and V.32bis.</DD>

<DT><B>V.110 and V.120</B></DT>

<DD>Connects to a remote ISDN DCE using V.110 or V.120 provided by the GSM network provider.</DD>

<DT><B>HDLC PPP</B></DT>

<DD>Connects to the Internet using the GSM network provider.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions of the operating system support the dynamic selection of GSM logical protocols by users and communications applications such as RAS. The inclusion of one or more <B>Protocol\GSM</B> registry entries enables the corresponding protocols to be selected in the user interface and indicated through TAPI and Unimodem. When a protocol is selected in the user interface, Unimodem issues the corresponding AT commands prior to originating a call. These commands are issued as part of a sequence of commands that set response format and presentation, carrier detect on, and so forth.</P>
