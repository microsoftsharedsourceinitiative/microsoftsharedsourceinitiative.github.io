<P>Serial port modems send and receive wave data through a serial communications port.</P>

<P>Voice modems that have a separate, nonserial, wave device interface require synchronization between the modem and wave device. The wave wrapper performs all synchronization for these wave devices. The MMSystem calls the wave wrapper which calls Unimodem to send modem AT commands. The wave wrapper calls back the MMSystem to control the wave device. </P>

<P>The following types of multimedia devices are usually installed by the modem INF:

<UL>
	<LI>A line device that allows audio to be recorded from and played to the phone line during an active call.</LI>

	<LI>A handset device that allows audio to be recorded from and played to the local telephone handset. If the modem does not support a handset device, this device will not be installed.</LI>

	<LI>A game-compatible device that ensures compatibility with Windows games and other multimedia applications.</LI>
</UL>
