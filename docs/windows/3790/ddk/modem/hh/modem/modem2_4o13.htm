<P>WHQL standards require that upgradeable modems have hardware ID strings that can be updated. </P>

<P>The following problems might occur during a modem upgrade if the modem’s hardware ID cannot be updated:

<UL>
	<LI>The upgraded modem might not be automatically detected as a new device. Remove the old modem installation (for example, registry entries and unused files) during your upgrade process to avoid this problem.</LI>

	<LI>The new INF file might contain a hardware ID that duplicates the hardware ID used in the old INF file. In this case, see <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">How Setup Selects Drivers</A> to see how INF files and drivers are chosen for installation.</LI>
</UL>

<P>If the user upgrades to (or reinstalls) Windows&nbsp;XP or a later version,  then the upgraded modem will be detected and automatically reinstalled at system startup time. If the hardware ID was not changed after a modem firmware upgrade, the operating system will use the old (and possibly incorrect) INF file to install the old drivers.</P>
