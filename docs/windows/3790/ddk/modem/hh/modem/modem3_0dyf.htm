<P>This section does not describe how to configure every possible modem feature. You must determine the capabilities of your modem and adapt the content of these sample INF sections to your modem. To determine which items to add, delete, or modify in these <I>add-registry-sections</I>, see <A HREF="modemref1_9wz6.htm">Modem INF File Entries</A>. </P>

<P>The <I>SmpData.inf</I> file includes the following <I>add-registry-sections</I>: 

<DL>
<DT><B>All</B></DT>

<DD>Defines the registry entries that are common to all modems installed by the INF file.</DD>

<DT><B>MfgAddReg</B></DT>

<DD>Defines the registry entries which are common to all modems made by Microsoft that can be installed by the INF file.</DD>

<DT>&lt;ModemN&gt;<B>.AddReg</B></DT>

<DD>Defines the registry entries that are specific to each modem.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>The relationships between these <I>add-registry-sections </I>are established by INF entries similar those in the following example, which specifies the <B>Manufacturer</B> section, <I>Models</I> section, and <I>add-registry-section</I> for <B>Modem1</B>:</P>

<PRE>[Manufacturer]
%Microsoft% = Microsoft

[Microsoft]
%Modem1% = Modem1, SERENUM\MSFT5600
%Modem1% = Modem1, *MSFT5600

[Modem1]</PRE>

<P><CODE>AddReg=All, MfgAddReg, Modem1.AddReg, EXTERNAL, 56K.RESP</CODE></P>

<PRE></PRE>

<P>The preceding example shows the structure for <B>Modem1</B>. Similar structures are required for additional modems.</P>

<P><I>SmpData.inf</I> specifies only one manufacturer: Microsoft. Additional manufacturers can be added in the <B>Manufacturers</B> section. Also “Microsoft” can be changed to “Models” or something appropriate to your application. For more information, see <A HREF="modem3_91rb.htm">Modifying the Manufacturer Section</A> and<I> </I><A HREF="modem3_9fhj.htm">Modifying the Models Section</A>.</P>

<P>The following sections contain additional information about modifying the modem INF <I>add-registry-sections </I>to support data modem features. The features documented here are the features that are most likely to require changes or that otherwise require special attention. For information about how to configure additional features, see <A HREF="modemref1_9wz6.htm">Modem INF File Entries</A>.</P>
