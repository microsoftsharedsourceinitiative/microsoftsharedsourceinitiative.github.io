<P>This section provides guidance for adapting voice modem support to Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions of the operating system. For details of the voice modem INF entries, see <A HREF="modemref3_8che.htm">Voice Modem INF File Entries</A>.</P>

<P>Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions of the operating system do not require a serial wave driver INF file. All voice INF file entries and settings are contained in the modem INF file on Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions of the operating system. Voice modem INF files for Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions of the operating system support additional entries and require setting a <A HREF="modemref3_5ooi.htm"><B>VoiceProfile</B></A> entry bit that is specific to Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions of the operating system. </P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The following example assumes a Rockwell modem. Substitute the correct settings for the target modem.</P>

<P class=proch><B><IMG SRC="../images/wedge.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>To add voice support for Windows 2000 and later versions of the operating system</B>

<OL>
	<LI>Use ProCalc to add the voice support bit for Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions of the operating system to the <A HREF="modemref3_5ooi.htm"><B>VoiceProfile</B></A> entry in the modem INF file.
<P>This is an example VoiceProfile entry with the bit set for Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions of the operating system:

<PRE>HKR,, VoiceProfile,     1,25,02,19,02
</PRE>
</LI>

	<LI>Adjust the voice INF file entries for Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions of the operating system to reflect the properties and commands of the modem chip set. 
<P>The following example shows the settings in the modem INF file for Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions of the operating system:

<PRE>HKR, WaveDriver,  XformModule    ,, "umdmxfrm.dll"
HKR, WaveDriver,  XformID        ,1, 01, 00
HKR, WaveDriver,  WaveDevices, 1, 01, 00
HKR, WaveDriver,  WaveHardwareID ,, "RockwellADPCMVoiceModemWave"
HKR, WaveDriver,  BaudRate       ,1, 00, c2, 01, 00</PRE>
