<P>Windows 2000 and later versions of the operating system provide adaptive answering for fax modems. The adaptive answering algorithm distinguishes between voice and fax, or data and fax. There is no way to distinguish between voice and data. </P>

<P>With adaptive answering enabled, the fax modem and computer determine the proper way to handle the call. For example, the fax modem receives fax calls that are handled by fax software or data calls that are handled by RAS.</P>

<P>The adaptive answer fax software included in Windows 2000 and later versions of the operating system is compatible with class 1 fax modems. It is possible to support adaptive answer in class 2 with a third-party application. However, there is no interface provided to integrate such an application with RAS. </P>

<P>The following topics provide information about the adaptive answering algorithm and fax entries for modem INF files:</P>
