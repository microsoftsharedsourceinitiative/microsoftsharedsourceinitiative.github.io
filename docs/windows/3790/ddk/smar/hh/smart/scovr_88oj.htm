<P>For WDM device drivers, the kernel device name is a name that is known only in the name space of the kernel. The symbolic link name is the name that a Win32® application uses to communicate with the driver. </P>

<P><I>Kernel Device Name</I>: Since this name is only known within kernel name space, the driver developer can choose the name, but the name must comply with the naming conventions for device names in NT-based operating systems. In particular, a device name must look like this:</P>

<P class=indent1><I>\Device\DeviceName[Unit]</I></P>

<P>where <I>DeviceName</I> is a name that reflects the type of driver and <I>Unit</I> is the zero-based unit number of that driver. The unit number is used to distinguish one device from another when there is more than one device of that type installed in a system.</P>

<P><I>Symbolic Link Name:</I> Since every driver must communicate with the smart card resource manager, the device must have a name that is accessible in Win32 name space. The name must look like this:</P>

<P class=indent1><I>\DosDevices\SCReader[Unit]</I></P>

<P>The unit number for the device in Win32 name space does not have to be the same as the one used to form the kernel device name. It should be the first available unit number. Use <A HREF="scfuncw_9b8f.htm"><B>SmartcardCreateLink</B> (WDM)</A> to generate the symbolic link name. This routine creates a correctly formatted name automatically.</P>
