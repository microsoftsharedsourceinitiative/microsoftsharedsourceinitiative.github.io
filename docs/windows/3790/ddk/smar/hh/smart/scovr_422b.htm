<P>VxD device drivers use the driver name and the link name.</P>

<P><I>Driver Name:</I> As with every other application that accesses a device managed by a VxD driver, a smart card application must provide the driver name when using the <B>DeviceIoControl</B> system call. The driver name must uniquely identify the driver and usually looks like DEVICE.VXD.</P>

<P><I>Symbolic Link Name:</I> Since the same VxD driver might potentially manage several different smart card reader devices, a VxD driver must add a key value to the registry indicating to the resource manager which reader device is managed by the driver. The value name must have the format <B>SCReader[<I>Unit</I>]</B>, and it must be assigned to the <B>Devices</B> key under the following registry hive:</P>

<P><B>System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Smclib</B></P>

<P>The VxD version of the driver library routine <A HREF="scfunc_5fq7.htm"><B>SmartcardCreateLink</B> (VxD)</A> automatically adds a value with the appropriate format to the appropriate registry key. </P>
