<DT><A NAME="ddk_b_picture_kg_gly"></A><B>B picture</B></DT>

<DD>Bidirectionally-coded picture. A picture type that uses the closest past I or P picture and the closest future I or P picture as the reference for motion-compensated prediction.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_backing_store_kg_gly"></A><B>backing store</B></DT>

<DD>A mass-storage device such as a disk that serves as backup “memory” for paging when physical memory is full. 

<P><I>See also</I> <A HREF="glossary_6bnd.htm#ddk_paging_file_kg_gly">paging file</A>.
</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_balance_set_kg_gly"></A><B>balance set</B></DT>

<DD>The set of processes whose threads are eligible for execution. 

<P>A process is either included in or excluded from the balance set. A kernel-mode process remains in the balance set while any of its threads owns a mutex object. Each thread that owns one or more mutexes continues to run until it releases its last mutex, when the thread is suspended. Until every thread has released every mutex, the process remains part of the balance set.


<P>At any given moment, the balance set depends on the amount of physical memory (pages) available to back the virtual address space associated with each active process. If a physical memory shortage occurs, the Memory Manager first reduces the working set for each active process to its minimum, and then removes processes from the balance set, if necessary.

<DT><A NAME="ddk_banked_callback_gg_gly"></A><B>banked callback</B></DT>

<DD>A callback routine provided by the display drive to enable GDI to access banked memory. GDI cannot directly access banked memory that is associated with a banked frame buffer. Consequently, the display driver of a device with such a frame buffer must divide the frame buffer into a series of contiguous banks and provide a means for GDI to perform its draw operations to the appropriate frame buffer banks. That is, GDI is made to write data to one bank of the frame buffer before being moved to subsequent banks, as necessary, to complete the draw operation through a mechanism referred to as "banked callbacks."</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_banked_memory_gg_gly"></A><B>banked memory</B></DT>

<DD>Memory that is partitioned into distinct blocks. Prior to the advent of PCI devices, most video cards could expose only 64 KB of video memory to the system at a time. This memory was present at physical address 0xa0000. The video card typically had considerably more than 64 KB of memory, and would map views of this larger frame buffer into the 64 KB window. This process was referred to as <I>banking</I>. A bank is one 64 KB block of the frame buffer. The current bank is the bank that is visible to the CPU.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_based_section_kg_gly"></A><B>based section</B></DT>

<DD>A section allocated at the same virtual address for each process that has a view of the section.

<DT><A NAME="ddk_basic_service_set_gg"></A><B>Basic Service Set (BSS)</B></DT>

<DD>A cell in an 802.11 LAN. An 802.11 LAN uses a cellular architecture that divides the system into a number of cells. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_basic_service_set_identifier_gg"></A><B>Basic Service Set identifier (BSSID)</B></DT>

<DD>Identifies a Basic Service Set.(BSS).

<DT><A NAME="ddk_big_endian_kg_gly"></A><B>big-endian</B></DT>

<DD>A processor memory architecture in which byte N is the most significant, and in conventional layout diagrams, is the leftmost byte of:

<UL>
	<LI>A word composed of bytes N and (N + 1).</LI>

	<LI>A doubleword composed of bytes N, (N + 1), (N + 2), and (N + 3).</LI>

	<LI>A K-byte memory entity composed of bytes N, (N + 1),...,(N + K – 1).</LI>
</UL>


<P>The address of the preceding word, doubleword, or K-byte entity is its most significant byte, N.


<P>Some RISC processors can be configured for either big-endian or <I>little-endian</I> byte addressing. For a big-endian configuration, the most significant bit of a 16-bit <B>short</B> value is the leftmost bit at byte N, while the least significant bit is the rightmost bit of byte (N + 1). 


<P>The terms "big-endian" and "little-endian" are derived from Jonathan Swift's <I>Gulliver’s Travels</I>.

<DT><A NAME="_bios_glossary"></A><B>BIOS</B></DT>

<DD>Basic input/output system. A set of low-level routines that works closely with the hardware to support the transfer of information between elements of the system, such as memory, disks, and the monitor. Although critical to performance, the BIOS is usually invisible to the end user; however, programmers can access it.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="_bios_enumerator_glossary"></A><B>BIOS enumerator</B></DT>

<DD>In a non-ACPI Plug and Play system, the BIOS enumerator identifies the hardware devices on the motherboard of the computer. The BIOS supports a programming interface that allows all Plug and Play computers to be queried in a common manner.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_bit_block_transfer_gg_gly"></A><B>bit-block transfer</B></DT>

<DD>A programming technique that manipulates blocks of bits in memory that represent the color and other attributes of a rectangular block of pixels forming a screen image. The bit block is moved through a computer's video RAM as a unit so that its pixels can be rapidly displayed in a desired location on the screen. The bits can also be altered: light and dark portions of an image can be reversed, for example. Successive displays can thus be used to change the appearance of an image or to move it around on the screen. Some computers contain special graphics hardware to manipulate bit blocks on the screen independently of the contents of the rest of the screen. This speeds the animation of small shapes, because a program need not constantly compare and redraw the background around the moving shape. Also called <I>bitblt</I> <I>or</I> <I>blt</I>. 

<P>A <I>stretched bit-block transfer</I> copies a rectangular block of pixels to a rectangle of different size at a different location.


<P>A <I>nonstretched bit-block transfer</I> copies a rectangular block of pixels to a rectangle of the same size at a different location.
