</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_asynchronous_i_o_kg_gly"></A><B>asynchronous I/O</B></DT>

<DD>A model for I/O in which the operations carried out to satisfy I/O requests do not necessarily occur in sequence. The application that originally made the request can continue executing (rather than waiting for its I/O to complete), the I/O Manager or a higher-level driver can reorder I/O requests as they are received, and a lowest-level driver can start an I/O operation on a device before it has completed the preceding request, particularly in a multiprocessor machine.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_asynchronous_procedure_call_kg_gly"></A><B>asynchronous procedure call</B></DT>

<DD>A kernel-defined control object which represents a procedure that is called asynchronously. Asynchronous procedure calls (APCs) are thread-context dependent; that is, they are queued to a particular thread for execution. There are three different types of APCs in the kernel:

<UL>
	<LI><I>User APC</I>—used by certain asynchronous system services to allow user-mode applications or protected subsystems to synchronize thread execution with the completion of an operation or with an event such as a timer’s expiration. User APCs are, by default, disabled; that is, they are queued to the user-mode thread, but are not executed, except at well-defined points in the program. Specifically, they can be executed only when an application or protected subsystem has either called a <I>wait service </I>and has enabled alerts to occur, or called the <I>test-alert service</I>.</LI>

	<LI><I>Kernel APC</I>—normal kernel-mode APCs. They are much like a normal user APC except that they are executable by default. That is, they are enabled except when the thread is already executing a Kernel APC. (Note that a special Kernel APC always preempts a normal Kernel APC.)</LI>

	<LI><I>Special Kernel APC</I>—an APC that cannot be blocked, except by running at a raised IRQL. Special Kernel APCs are executed at APC_LEVEL IRQL (see <A HREF="glossary_50mx.htm#ddk_idt_kg_gly"><I>IDT</I></A>), in kernel mode. These types of APCs are used by the system to force a thread to execute a procedure in the thread’s context. For example, when the I/O Manager needs to get back into the context of the original requester of the I/O operation so that it can copy buffers, and so forth. In order to do this, the I/O Manager must be able to access the virtual address space of the thread/process, and the most efficient way to complete the operation is to be in the calling thread’s context.</LI>
</UL>
</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_asynchronous_rendering_gg_gly"></A><B>asynchronous rendering</B></DT>

<DD>A display driver supports asynchronous rendering if it can hand off a batch of one or more DDI drawing operations to the graphics coprocessor, returning immediately to GDI. In order to perform graphics operations of its own, GDI must synchronize itself with the bitmap or surface. To do this, GDI calls a display driver-implemented synchronization routine called either <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_3.Click()"><B>DrvSynchronize</B></A> (for device-managed surfaces) or <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_4.Click()"><B>DrvSynchronizeSurface</B></A> (for arbitrary surfaces). 

<P><I>See</I> <A HREF="glossary_6vsp.htm#ddk_synchronization_routine_gg_gly">synchronization routine</A>.
</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_at_gg"></A><B>AT</B></DT>

<DD>Command set A telecommunication (AT) device control protocol. This protocol is used to control modems. 

<P><I>See also</I>, TIA-602 and <A HREF="glossary_7fy1.htm#ddk_v.25ter_gg">V.25ter</A>.
</DD>

<DT><A NAME="_ata_glossary"></A><B>ATA</B></DT>

<DD>AT Attachment. An integrated bus usually used between host processors and disk drives. Used interchangeably with IDE.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="_atapi_glossary"></A><B>ATAPI</B></DT>

<DD>AT Attachment Packet Interface. A hardware and software specification that documents the interface between a host computer and CD-ROM drives using the ATA bus. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="_atm_glossary"></A><B>ATM</B></DT>

<DD>Asynchronous transfer mode. A transmission protocol that segments user traffic into small, fixed-size units called cells, which are transmitted to their destination, where they are reassembled into the original traffic. During transmission, cells from different users may be intermixed asynchronously to maximize utilization of network resources.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_audio_class_ks"></A><B>audio class</B></DT>

<DD>The class of filters that deal with PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) or similar digitized data or analog signals.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_authentication_gg"></A><B>authentication</B></DT>

<DD>The interchange of information between the access point and the station, where each side proves the knowledge of a given password. Authentication is required before a station can join a BSS through an access point that the station has located.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_av_c_ks"></A><B>AV/C</B></DT>

<DD>The protocol used to communicate with Audio/Video Control (AV/C) devices. Examples of AV/C devices include Mini Digital Video Camcorders and time-shifting digital recorders.</DD>
