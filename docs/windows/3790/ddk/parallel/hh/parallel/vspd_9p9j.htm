<P>The system-supplied bus driver for parallel ports enforces exclusive access to a parallel device attached to a parallel port. If a parallel device is open, the parallel port bus driver fails any subsequent <A HREF="cisspd_5yk2.htm">IRP_MJ_CREATE</A> requests for the device until the device has been closed. A client must open a parallel device before it sends other I/O requests to the device or calls the <A HREF="cisspd_9noy.htm">parallel device callback routines</A>. A client must not attempt to communicate with a parallel device after the client has closed its file on a device. A client must close a device to allow other clients to access the device.</P>

<P>A client usually does the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Opens a parallel device</LI>

	<LI>Connects to a parallel device – see <A HREF="vspd_6rzb.htm">Connecting to a Parallel Device</A></LI>

	<LI>Obtains information about the parallel device – see <A HREF="vspd_90kn.htm">Obtaining Information about a Parallel Device</A></LI>

	<LI>Locks the device – see <A HREF="vspd_8js7.htm">Locking and Unlocking a Parallel Port for Use by a Parallel Device</A></LI>

	<LI>Does a sequence of operations on the device</LI>

	<LI>Disconnects from a parallel device – see <A HREF="vspd_6rzb.htm">Connecting to a Parallel Device</A></LI>

	<LI>Unlocks the device – see <A HREF="vspd_8js7.htm">Locking and Unlocking a Parallel Port for Use by a Parallel Device</A></LI>

	<LI>Closes the device</LI>
</UL>

<P>Note that in a Plug and Play environment, a device can be removed or added whenever there are no open files on it. In general, every time a parallel device is added, Plug and Play assigns a different location and resources.</P>
