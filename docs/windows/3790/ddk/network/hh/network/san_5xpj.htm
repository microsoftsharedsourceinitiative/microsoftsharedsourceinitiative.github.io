<P>Windows Sockets applications can benefit from using a system area network (SAN). To use a SAN, these applications must have a SAN service provider DLL and a proxy driver for that DLL. </P>

<P>To use a specific SAN to transfer data, you also need a reliable transport for that SAN. If a reliable transport is not fully implemented in the SAN NIC hardware, you need a transport driver for the SAN. If required, a SAN transport driver is specified by the SAN NIC vendor and communicates with its overlying SAN proxy driver and underlying SAN NIC through private interfaces. </P>

<P>For information on implementing a SAN service provider DLL and its proxy driver, see <A HREF="wsdp_6hnr.htm">Windows Sockets Direct</A>. Note, however, that this section does not specify how to write a SAN transport driver.</P>

<P>You need an NDIS miniport driver to transfer data that must flow over networks other than your specific SAN such as Ethernet, ATM, or another SAN. TCP/IP uses the NDIS miniport driver to send data both to the SAN NIC and over such networks.</P>

<P>For information on implementing miniport and transport drivers, see <A HREF="101rm_0odj.htm#ddk_miniport_drivers_ng">Miniport Drivers</A> and <A HREF="303tdi_1otj.htm">TDI Transports and Their Clients</A>.</P>
