<P><B>Note:</B> vendor-supplied network upgrades are not supported in Windows XP (SP1 and later), Windows Server 2003, and later operating systems.</P>

<P>The network upgrade process is divided into three distinct phases, which can be briefly summarized as follows: 

<UL>
	<LI><B>Winnt32 phase</B>
<P><I>Winnt32.exe</I> calls NetSetup. NetSetup writes network component-specific information to the AnswerFile and calls any vendor-supplied network migration DLLs. The DLLs write component-specific information to the AnswerFile. <I>Winnt32.exe</I> copies the Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;2000 or later files to the system being upgraded and prepares the boot sector on the system. The system then boots into text mode.
</LI>

	<LI><B>Text mode phase</B>
<P>Installation messages are displayed on a blue, text-based screen. Setup performs the basic Windows&nbsp;2000 or later installation. The system then boots into GUI mode.
</LI>

	<LI><B>GUI mode phase</B>
<P>NetSetup processes the <I>winnt.sif</I> file, which is also known as the AnswerFile, and installs the network components. Network migration DLLs can display a user interface in which a user or system administrator can specify parameter values for network components. Either NetSetup or a network migration DLL writes a network component's preupgrade parameter values to the Windows&nbsp;2000 or later registry.
</LI>
</UL>
