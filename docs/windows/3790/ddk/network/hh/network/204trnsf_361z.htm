<P>When a miniport driver that supports media-specific information, or priority receives a packet to send, it might either:

<UL>
	<LI>Get <B>TimeToSend</B></LI>

	<LI>Get <B>SizeMediaSpecificInformation </B>and <B>MediaSpecificInformation</B></LI>
</UL>

<P>Before returning, <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> in a serialized miniport driver sets the <B>Status</B> member for each packet that it is passed. It sets <B>Status </B>to something other than NDIS_STATUS_PENDING if it completes the send synchronously. Otherwise, <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> sets the <B>Status </B>member<B> </B>to NDIS_STATUS_PENDING.  When the send completes, the status of the send <I>must</I> be returned in the <I>Status</I> parameter to <A HREF="103ndisx_2kxe.htm"><B>NdisMSendComplete</B></A>. After <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> returns, the <B>Status </B>member of the OOB data, as well as all other members, are inaccessible to the NIC driver.</P>

<P>The NDIS library ignores the OOB block in all packet descriptors it submits to the <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> function of a deserialized driver or the <I>MiniportCoSendPackets</I> function of a connection-oriented driver. NDIS assumes a deserialized miniport driver will complete each packet descriptor input to <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> asynchronously with <B>NdisMSendComplete,</B> and that a connection-oriented driver will complete each packet descriptor input to <I>MiniportCoSendPackets</I> with <A HREF="103ndisx_5t2q.htm"><B>NdisMCoSendComplete</B></A>. Consequently, the <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> function of a deserialized driver or the <I>MiniportCoSendPackets</I> function of a connection-oriented driver usually ignores the <B>Status</B> member of the NDIS_PACKET_OOB_DATA block, but it can set this member to the same status that it subsequently passes to <B>NdisM(Co)SendComplete</B>.</P>

<P>If <I>MiniportSend</I> is called, and the send is synchronous, status is returned as the status of <I>MiniportSend</I>. The OOB data is <I>never</I> used to return the status of a <I>MiniportSend</I> operation.</P>

<P>In summary:

<UL>
	<LI>All but the Status member of the OOB data is read-only to the <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> function of a serialized miniport driver. Status is written to return the status of the send for each packet that is completed synchronously.</LI>

	<LI>NDIS ignores the <B>Status</B> member in packet descriptors that it submits to the <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> function of a deserialized driver or to the <I>MiniportCoSendPackets</I> function of a connection-oriented driver. The <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> function of a deserialized driver must complete each packet asynchronously with <B>NdisMSendComplete</B> for each packet in the incoming array. Similarly, the <I>MiniportCoSendPackets</I> function of a connection-oriented driver must complete each packet asynchronously with <B>NdisMCoSendComplete</B> for each packet in the incoming array. </LI>

	<LI>When a packet is sent asynchronously, either by <I>MiniportSend</I> or <I>MiniportSendPackets</I>, the final status of the send is <I>always</I> returned as a parameter to <B>NdisMSendComplete</B>. When a packet is sent asynchronously by <I>MiniportCoSendPackets</I>, the final status of the send is <I>always</I> returned as a parameter to <B>NdisMCoSendComplete</B>. </LI>

	<LI>All the OOB data is read-only to <I>MiniportSend</I>. <I>MiniportSend</I> <I>always</I> returns the status of the send as the status of <I>MiniportSend</I>. If the status returned is NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, the status is returned as a parameter to <B>NdisMSendComplete</B>.</LI>
