<P>Windows Sockets applications can benefit from using a system area network (SAN). These applications can use a SAN to transfer data in bulk form and to drop data directly onto the SAN network, without copying across the user-kernel boundary, using a technology called <A HREF="wsdp_6hnr.htm">Windows Sockets Direct</A>. Windows Sockets Direct lets these applications use a SAN transparently. </P>

<P>For each Windows Sockets application, Windows Sockets Direct can either:

<UL>
	<LI>Route data traffic that flows over a SAN directly to the SAN.
<P>The system-supplied Windows Sockets switch component of Windows Sockets Direct routes data traffic for a SAN that originates from a Windows Sockets application directly to the SAN NIC to be transferred over the SAN network. The switch uses that SAN's particular Windows Sockets service provider to transfer data. 
</LI>

	<LI>Route data traffic that flows over other networks through TCP/IP.
<P>To route data traffic that is not for a specific SAN from a Windows Sockets application, the switch must use the TCP/IP service provider. Non-SAN–specific data traffic includes, for example, datagrams, multicast, and connections that must be routed. Non-SAN–specific data traffic is then routed through TCP/IP and the NDIS miniport driver to the SAN NIC.
