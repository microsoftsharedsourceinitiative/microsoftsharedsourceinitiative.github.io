<P>The OID_CO_TAPI_GET_CALL_DIAGNOSTICS OID requests a call manager or MCM driver to return diagnostic information about a failed call or a call torn down by the remote TAPI party. </P>

<P>This request uses a CO_TAPI_CALL_DIAGNOSTICS structure, which is defined as follows:</P>

<PRE class=syntax>typedef struct _CO_TAPI_CALL_DIAGNOSTICS {
  OUT ULONG  ulOrigin;
  OUT ULONG  ulReason;
  OUT NDIS_VAR_DATA_DESC  DiagInfo;
} CO_TAPI_CALL_DIAGNOSTICS, *PCO_TAPI_CALL_DIAGNOSTICS;</PRE>

<DL>
<DT><B>ulOrigin</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the origination of the call as one of the following LINECALLORIGIN_ constants:

</DL>
</DD>
