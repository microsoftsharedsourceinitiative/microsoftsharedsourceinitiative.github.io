<P><B>NetClient</B> components are considered to be network providers because they provide network services to user applications. The Microsoft Client for Networks and the NetWare Client are examples of <B>NetClient</B> components.</P>

<P>In addition to being a network provider, a <B>NetClient</B> component can also be a print provider. A print provider provides print services to user applications over a network.</P>

<P>A <B>NetClient</B> component is always installed as a network provider. An INF file that installs a <B>NetClient</B> component does not require a NetworkProvider section for that component unless at least one of the following is true: 

<UL>
	<LI>An alternative device name is specified for the component.</LI>

	<LI>A short name for the component is specified for use with the <B>net view</B> command. For more information, see <A HREF="501install_3qav.htm">Including a NetworkProvider Section</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>An INF that installs a <B>NetClient</B> component that is a print provider must contain a <B>PrintProvider</B> section for that component. For more information, see <A HREF="501install_76xz.htm">Including a PrintProvider Section</A>.</P>

<P>An INF file that installs a <B>NetClient</B> component must also contain an <I>add-registry-section</I> (referenced by a <B>AddReg</B> directive in the <I>service-install-section</I> for a component) that adds a <B>NetworkProvider</B> key to the component's <I>service</I> key. For more information, see <A HREF="501install_9n53.htm">Specifying the Name and Provider Path for a NetClient Component</A>.</P>
