<P>NDIS supports the following connection-oriented drivers:

<UL>
	<LI>Connection-oriented client</LI>

	<LI>Call manager</LI>

	<LI>Integrated miniport call manager (MCM) driver</LI>

	<LI>Connection-oriented miniport driver</LI>
</UL>

<P>The following figure shows a configuration of connection-oriented clients, a call manager, and a miniport driver.</P>

<P>A <I>connection-oriented miniport driver</I> controls one or more network interface cards (NICs) and provides an interface between connection-oriented protocols (connection-oriented clients and call managers) and the NIC hardware. For a summary of connection-oriented operations performed by a connection-oriented miniport driver, see <A HREF="401condis_9omf.htm">Connection-Oriented Operations Performed by Miniport Drivers</A>.</P>

<P>A <I>call manager</I> is an NDIS protocol driver that provides call setup and tear-down services for connection-oriented clients. A call manager has the following characteristics: 

<UL>
	<LI>Uses the send and receive capabilities of a connection-oriented miniport driver to exchange signaling messages with network entities, such as network switches or remote peers. </LI>

	<LI>Supports one or more signaling protocols, such as ATM UNI 3.1, as specified by the ATM Forum. For a summary of connection-oriented operations performed by a call manager, see <A HREF="401condis_0lbb.htm">Connection-Oriented Operations Performed by Call Managers</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>An integrated MCM driver is a connection-oriented miniport driver that also provides call manager services to connection-oriented clients. An MCM driver has the following characteristics:

<UL>
	<LI>Provides the same connection-oriented services to clients as a call manager that is paired with a connection-oriented miniport driver; however, the call manager-to-miniport driver interface is internal to the driver and therefore opaque to NDIS. </LI>

	<LI>Multiple call managers and MCM drivers can coexist in the same environment. </LI>

	<LI>Each call manager or MCM driver can support multiple signaling protocols.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For a detailed comparison, see <A HREF="401condis_3iav.htm">How an MCM Driver Differs from a Call Manager</A>.</P>

<P>A <I>connection-oriented client </I>has the following characteristics:

<UL>
	<LI>Uses the call setup and tear-down services of a call manager or MCM driver.</LI>

	<LI>Uses the send and receive capabilities of a connection-oriented miniport driver or an MCM driver to send and receive data. </LI>

	<LI>At its upper edge can provide its own network and transport-layer services to a higher-layer application</LI>

	<LI>At its lower edge uses the services of a call manager and a connection-oriented miniport driver, or it uses the services of an MCM driver</LI>

	<LI>Can be an adaptation layer, such as IP/ATM and LAN Emulation (LANE), that resides between a legacy protocol and connection-oriented NDIS. 
<P>Both IP/ATM and LAN Emulation (LANE) use call management services to establish underlying connections, but hide the connection-oriented nature of this interface from the connectionless protocols above it. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of a connection-oriented client's upper-edge interface is beyond the scope of NDIS documentation. If a client serves as an adaptation layer, its upper-edge interface is defined by the protocol that it adapts to connection-oriented NDIS.</P>
