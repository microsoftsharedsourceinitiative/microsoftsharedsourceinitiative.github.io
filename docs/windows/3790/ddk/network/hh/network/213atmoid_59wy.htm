<H3><A NAME="ddk_oid_atm_cells_hec_error_nr"></A>OID_ATM_CELLS_HEC_ERROR</H3>

<P>The number of cells that were received with a header error control (HEC) error. A HEC error is a checksum error for a cell header.</P>



<H3><A NAME="ddk_oid_atm_rcv_cells_dropped_nr"></A>OID_ATM_RCV_CELLS_DROPPED</H3>

<P>The number of received cells that were dropped for any reason.</P>

<P>An ATM miniport driver must support this OID on an per-adapter basis and can optionally support this OID on a per-VC basis.</P>



<H3><A NAME="ddk_oid_atm_rcv_cells_ok_nr"></A>OID_ATM_RCV_CELLS_OK</H3>

<P>The number of cells that were received without errors.</P>

<P>An ATM miniport driver must support this OID on an per-adapter basis and can optionally support this OID on a per-VC basis.</P>



<H3><A NAME="ddk_oid_atm_rcv_reassembly_error_nr"></A>OID_ATM_RCV_REASSEMBLY_ERROR</H3>

<P>The number of packet reassembly errors that have occurred. Such an error occurs when a packet reassembled from received cells fails a checksum test or if the reassembly times out (that is, if the NIC receives all but the last cell for a packet and times out waiting for that cell).</P>



<H3><A NAME="ddk_oid_atm_rcv_invalid_vpi_vci_nr"></A>OID_ATM_RCV_INVALID_VPI_VCI</H3>

<P>The number of cells that were received with unrecognized VPI and/or VCI values.</P>



<H3><A NAME="ddk_oid_atm_xmit_cells_ok_nr"></A>OID_ATM_XMIT_CELLS_OK</H3>
