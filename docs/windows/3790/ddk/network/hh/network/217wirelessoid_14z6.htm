<P>The OID_802_11_DISASSOCIATE OID requests the miniport driver to command its NIC to disassociate from the current service set and turn off the radio. No data is associated with this OID. </P>

<P>If the NIC is associated with an access point when the miniport driver receives this OID, then the miniport driver should indicate a disconnect event upon a successful disassociation.</P>

<P>The miniport driver should maintain a list of the current service set Ids (SSIDs). Once a NIC has disassociated from an SSID, it should not use it again until it has associated with all other SSIDs or until OID_802_11_INFRASTRUCTURE_MODE has been set. If the NIC is not associated with an access point, the miniport driver should return an error code of NDIS_STATUS_ADAPTER_NOT_READY in response to OID_802_11_DISASSOCIATE.</P>
