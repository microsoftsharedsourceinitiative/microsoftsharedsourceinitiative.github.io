<P>The OID_802_11_SUPPORTED_RATES OID requests the miniport driver to return its NIC's data rate set, which includes the data rates that the NIC's radio supports.</P>

<P>Data rate sets are encoded as eight octets; each of which describes a single rate in units of 0.5 Mbps. Rates from the 802.11 BSSBasicRateSet that are included in the supported rates are used for control and broadcast frames. </P>

<P>Each supported rate from the BSSBasicRateSet is encoded as an octet with the most significant bit (bit 7) set to 1. For example, a 1 Mbps rate in the BSSBasicRateSet is encoded as 0x82. </P>

<P>Rates that are not included in the BSSBasicRateSet are encoded with the most significant bit set to zero. For example, a 2 Mbps rate that does not belong to the BSSBasicRateSet is encoded as 0x04. </P>

<P>This OID uses the NDIS_802_11_RATES array, which is defined as follows:</P>

<PRE class=syntax>typedef  UCHAR   NDIS_802_11_RATES[8];
</PRE>

<P>The rates array contains a set of eight octets. Each octet contains a desired data rate in units of .5 Mbps.</P>
