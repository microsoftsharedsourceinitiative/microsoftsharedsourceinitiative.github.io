<P>NDIS drivers should be written so that they are easily portable across all platforms that support Windows&nbsp;2000 and later operating systems. In general, porting from one hardware platform to another should only require recompilation with a system-compatible compiler.</P>

<P>Follow these guidelines for writing NDIS drivers:

<UL>
	<LI>Avoid calling operating system-specific functions; instead, use the NDIS equivalents. NDIS exports a rich set of support functions for writing drivers, and by calling these functions, you can port the code between Microsoft operating systems that support NDIS. </LI>

	<LI>Write drivers in C; specifically, the ANSI C Standard. Avoid using any language features that are not supported by other system-compatible compilers. Do not use any features that the ANSI C standard designates as “implementation defined.”</LI>

	<LI>Avoid dependencies on data types whose size and layout vary across platforms. For example, do not write driver code that calls any C Run-Time Library functions instead of NDIS-provided functions.</LI>

	<LI>Do not use floating point operations in kernel mode. Attempting such operations will result in a fatal error.</LI>

	<LI>Use <B>#ifdef</B> and <B>#endif</B> statements to encapsulate code used to support platform-specific features.</LI>
</UL>
