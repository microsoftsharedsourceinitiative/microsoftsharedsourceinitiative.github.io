<P><B>TdiBuildAccept</B> sets up an internal device control IRP for a TDI_ACCEPT request to the underlying transport in which a local-node client has already opened a connection endpoint and associated it with a local-node address and to which the client has already issued a TDI_LISTEN request. </P>

<H4>Parameters</H4>

<DL>
<DT><I>Irp</I></DT>

<DD>Pointer to a client-supplied IRP, either originating in a higher level network component or allocated with <B>TdiBuildInternalDeviceControlIrp</B>. </DD>

<DT><I>DevObj</I></DT>

<DD>Pointer to the device object created by the next lower TDI transport driver.</DD>

<DT><I>FileObj</I></DT>

<DD>Pointer to a file object representing a connection endpoint. The client previously made a successful request, set up with <B>TdiBuildAssociateAddress</B>, to the transport to set up an association between this connection and a local-node address. When the association was established, the client also issued a listen request, set up with <B>TdiBuildListen</B>, to the transport.  </DD>

<DT><I>CompRoutine</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the entry point of a client-supplied IoCompletion routine or NULL. The I/O Manager calls this routine when the given IRP is completed, unless the client sets this parameter to NULL. </DD>

<DT><I>Contxt</I></DT>

<DD>Pointer to a client-determined context. This client-supplied pointer is passed in to the IoCompletion routine when it is called with the completed IRP. <I>Contxt</I> is NULL if <I>CompRoutine</I> is NULL.</DD>

<DT><I>RequestConnectionInfo</I></DT>

<DD>Pointer to a caller-supplied buffer containing a TDI_CONNECTION_INFORMATION structure, set up to specify a valid remote-node client address from which the caller, a local-node client, can accept a connection. The local-node client also can provide buffered accept data, specified at <B>UserData</B> in this structure, that the underlying transport should send to the remote node when it transmits acceptance of the offered connection (see <A HREF="34bldmac_6cc2.htm"><B>TdiBuildListen</B></A> for details). </DD>

<DT><I>ReturnConnectionInfo</I></DT>

<DD>Pointer to a caller-supplied buffer in which the transport returns the remote-node client's address with which it has established an endpoint-to-endpoint connection for the local-node client. This buffer is also formatted as a  TDI_CONNECTION_INFORMATION structure. If the underlying transport does not provide this information, this parameter should be NULL.

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P><B>TdiBuildAccept </B>sets IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL as the <B>MajorFunction</B> and TDI_ACCEPT as the <B>MinorFunction</B> codes in the transport's I/O stack location of the given IRP.</P>

<P>When a kernel-mode client issues a TDI_ACCEPT request, it asks the underlying transport to accept an incoming request to connect from a remote-node client and, thereby, to enable network data reception on an established endpoint-to-endpoint connection. </P>

<P>Usually, a client sends an accept request in response to a return from its preceding listen request, set up with <B>TdiBuildListen</B> with the TDI_QUERY_ACCEPT option selected. If a client did not set this value in the <I>Flags</I> for its listen request, its accept request fails because the underlying transport has already established an endpoint-to-endpoint connection when the listen request completes.</P>

<P>Most TDI transports have a time-out feature that prevents attempts to establish endpoint-to-endpoint connections from hanging when a remote node does not respond. Therefore, a client must either accept or reject a connection as soon as possible after completion of its listen request. The interval between client notification of a remote-node peer connection offer and that local client's connection acceptance or rejection is subject to a transport-determined time-out limit, usually something less than one second.</P>

<P>A client indicates its acceptances of a connection to the remote-node peer by submitting a request set up by <B>TdiBuildAccept</B> to the underlying transport. It indicates its rejection of a connection offer by submitting an IRP set up with <B>TdiBuildDisconnect</B>. </P>

<P>The local client's registered ClientEvent(Chained)Receive(Expedited) handler(s) can be called before the I/O Manager formally completes its processing of the accept IRP. That is, the remote-node peer can start sending data to the local client as soon as the remote node receives an acceptance of the offered connection. </P>
