<P>NDIS supports the following WMI operations:

<UL>
	<LI>Enumerate adapter and Enumerate VC
<P>NDIS registers global GUIDs (GUID_NDIS_ENUMERATE_ADAPTER and GUID_NDIS_ENUMERATE_VC) with WMI that allow WMI clients to enumerate all adapters (miniport driver instances) and all named VCs. Since NDIS itself keeps track of all loaded miniport drivers and all named VCs, NDIS does not need to query miniport drivers for such information. 
</LI>

	<LI>QUERY SINGLE INSTANCE and SET SINGLE INSTANCE
<P>Through NDIS, a WMI client can query or set a single instance of a data block, which corresponds to single OID. For a query, NDIS returns all the information associated with an OID. A WMI client cannot query or set a data item within an OID. For example, a query of GUID_NDIS_GEN_CO_LINK_SPEED returns both the outbound and inbound speed. A WMI client cannot query just the outbound speed or just the inbound speed.
</LI>

	<LI>QUERY ALL DATA
<P>NDIS satisfies a QUERY ALL DATA request on a particular GUID by obtaining the appropriate data and returning the combined data for all instances of the GUID to WMI. For example, in response to a QUERY ALL DATA on GUID_NDIS_ENUMERATE_ADAPTER, NDIS returns to WMI a list of all loaded miniport drivers. For a QUERY ALL DATA on the GUID that maps to OID_GEN_CO_XMIT_PDUS_OK, NDIS queries that OID for each VC on each connection-oriented miniport driver and returns the combined data to WMI.  Since the overhead for a QUERY ALL DATA may be very high, it is recommended that WMI clients QUERY ALL DATA only to enumerate adapters and VCs. After determining the adapter or VC interest, the client can then query individual GUID instances.
</LI>

	<LI>EVENT NOTIFICATION
<P>WMI clients can register with NDIS to be notified for a particular miniport driver status indication. When such a event occurs, NDIS passes the status information with the appropriate GUID to WMI for delivery to the client(s).
</LI>
