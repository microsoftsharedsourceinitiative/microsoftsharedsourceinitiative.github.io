<P>NDIS automatically registers with WMI each instance of a miniport driver (that is, each functional device object created by NDIS in response to a successful return of <A HREF="101mini_9jzm.htm"><I>MiniportInitialize</I></A>). After a miniport driver instance is registered as a data provider with WMI, WMI clients can send it queries and sets and register to receive miniport driver status indications. A miniport driver does not have to explicitly register with WMI; NDIS automatically does this for the miniport driver after the miniport driver initializes.</P>

<P>When the miniport driver is unloaded (that is, after the miniport driver's <A HREF="101mini_6stu.htm"><I>MiniportHalt</I></A> function returns), NDIS automatically deregisters the miniport driver instance with WMI so that WMI will no longer send queries or sets to the miniport driver.</P>

<P>For each miniport driver instance registered with WMI, NDIS registers GUIDs (globally unique identifiers) that each correspond to a particular OID or a miniport driver status indication. For each miniport driver, NDIS registers GUIDs for a standard set of required OIDs and miniport driver status indications. For more information, see <A HREF="205mpinfo_32lj.htm">Standard Miniport Driver OIDs Registered with WMI</A> and <A HREF="205mpinfo_1ox3.htm">Standard Miniport Driver Status Registered with WMI</A>. If a miniport driver supports custom OIDs or status indications NDIS also registers GUIDs for these with WMI. For more information, see <A HREF="205mpinfo_50fb.htm">Customized OIDs and Status Indications</A>.</P>

<P>For connection-oriented miniport drivers, NDIS also registers any named VCs. Only VCs that a call manager, integrated miniport call manager (MCM), or connection-oriented client has named with <A HREF="103ndisx_6c8i.htm"><B>NdisCoAssignInstanceName</B></A> are visible to WMI clients. For more information, see <A HREF="205mpinfo_3eg7.htm">Support for Named VCs</A>.</P>
