<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>NetSetup calls a network migration DLL's <B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B> function once during the GUI-mode phase of the operating system upgrade. NetSetup calls <B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B> before calling the DLL's <B>DoPostUpgradeProcessing</B> function.</P>

<P>The <B>PostUpgradeInitialize</B> function supplies the network migration DLL with information about the source operating system and the target operating system. Specifically, the <B>PostUpgradeInitialize</B> function specifies the product type (Microsoft Windows NT Workstation or Microsoft Windows NT Server) and build number of:

<UL>
	<LI>The product type and build number of the operating system being upgraded</LI>

	<LI>The product type and build number of the operating system being installed</LI>
</UL>

<P>The <B>PostUpgradeInitialize</B> function also supplies the complete path to the directory in which the network migration DLL stored temporary files during the Winnt32 phase of the operating system upgrade.</P>

<P>The <B>PostUpgradeInitialize</B> function passes a pointer (<I>pviVendorInfo</I>) to NetSetup that points to vendor information formatted as a VENDORINFO structure. NetSetup displays this information if <B>PostUpgradeInitialize </B>returns a Win32 error code.</P>

<P>If an error occurs, <B>PostUpgradeInitialize</B> returns a Win32 error code. NetSetup reports the error to the user, cleans up the upgrade DLL files, and asks the user to quit or continue the installation of the operating system.</P>
