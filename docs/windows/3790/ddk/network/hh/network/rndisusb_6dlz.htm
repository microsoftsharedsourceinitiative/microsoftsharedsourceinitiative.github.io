<H3><A NAME="ddk_usb_short_packets_ng"></A>USB Short Packets</H3>

<P>USB passes data over the wire in the form of USB packets, which should not be confused with NDIS or networking packets. The maximum length of a USB packet to or from a USB endpoint is limited to the value of the <I>wMaxPacketSize</I> field of the endpoint’s descriptor. For bulk pipes the maximum packet size is 64 bytes. Due to constraints of certain USB host controllers, there is a penalty associated with using short USB packets (for example, those of less then 64 bytes, when streaming data).</P>

<P>To work around this limitation, Remote NDIS USB devices may append zero-byte padding to data messages so that a short packet will not occur (within the constraints of the <I>MaxTransferSize</I> field of <A HREF="rndiscom_1r6v.htm">REMOTE_NDIS_INITIALIZE_MSG</A>). The <I>MessageLength</I> field of the final <A HREF="rndiscom_78x3.htm">REMOTE_NDIS_PACKET_MSG</A> does not include these appended padding bytes.</P>

<P>If the device has transmitted its last available REMOTE_NDIS_PACKET_MSG (so no more are left in the device’s queue), then it is acceptable to send a short USB packet.</P>

<P>If the last REMOTE_NDIS_PACKET_MSG of a device-send RNDIS data message (without any zero-byte padding) ends with a USB packet whose length is exactly the <I>wMaxPacketSize</I> for that endpoint, then the device may send an additional one-byte zero packet as an appended part of the transfer. Some device implementations are simplified by this allowance.</P>

<P>Similarly, some device-side USB chipsets do not detect the end of a received USB transfer that ends with a USB packet whose length is the <I>wMaxPacketSize</I> for that endpoint. For this reason, the host must append a one-byte zero packet to a data transfer that otherwise would have a length that is a multiple of the <I>wMaxPacketSize</I> of the receiving endpoint. USB RNDIS devices must tolerate the appended byte. The <I>MessageLength</I> field of the final REMOTE_NDIS_PACKET_MSG does not include this appended byte.</P>
