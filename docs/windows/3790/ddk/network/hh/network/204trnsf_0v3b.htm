<P>A connectionless miniport driver that supports multipacket sends declares the following miniport driver function:</P>

<PRE class=syntax><B>VOID
</B>  <B>MiniportSendPackets(
</B>    <B>IN NDIS_HANDLE</B>  <I>MiniportAdapterContext</I><B>,</B>
    <B>IN PPNDIS_PACKET</B>  <I>PacketArray</I><B>,</B>
    <B>IN UINT</B>  <I>NumberofPackets</I>
    <B>);</B></PRE>

<P>Each <I>PacketArray</I> is a pointer to an array of pointers to one or more packet descriptors. The miniport driver is responsible for sending packets in the priority order specified by the protocol driver. NDIS does not order the packets that it receives from a protocol driver but passes them to the miniport driver in the order that it received them from the protocol driver.</P>

<P>A miniport driver is not required to check the packet size; rather, the miniport driver should assume that a protocol driver will never send a packet that is too large. The protocol driver queries the miniport driver during initialization to determine the maximum packet size it supports. The protocol is responsible for passing only packets of a size supported by the miniport driver. </P>
