<P>The OID_CO_GET_ADDRESSES OID is used by the client to make a query to the call manager. This query is made in response to the call manager sending an OID_CO_ADDRESS_CHANGE to the client. In response to this query, the call manager sends the client an address list that is formatted as a CO_ADDRESS_LIST structure, defined as follows:</P>

<PRE class=syntax>typedef struct _CO_ADDRESS_LIST {
  ULONG  NumberOfAddressesAvailable;
  ULONG  NumberOfAddresses;
  CO_ADDRESS  AddressList;
} CO_ADDRESS_LIST, *PCO_ADDRESS_LIST;</PRE>

<P>The members of this structure contain the following information:

<DL>
<DT><B>NumberOfAddressesAvailable</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the maximum number of addresses in the call manager's list of addresses. Regardless of the actual number of addresses that the call manager returns to the client at <B>AddressList</B>, the size of the buffer at <B>AddressList</B> is always <B>NumberOfAddressesAvailable</B> multiplied by the address size, which is a fixed size specific to the call manager.</DD>

<DT><B>NumberOfAddresses</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of addresses that the call manager has written to <B>AddressList</B>.</DD>

<DT><B>AddressList</B></DT>

<DD>The alias address is formatted as a CO_ADDRESS structure, defined as follows:

<PRE>typedef struct _CO_ADDRESS {
  ULONG AddressSize;
  UCHAR Address[1];
} CO_ADDRESS, *PCO_ADDRESS;</PRE>


<P>The members of this structure contain the following information:


<DL>
<DT><B>AddressSize</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the size in bytes of the structure at <B>Address</B>.</DD>

<DT><B>Address</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies a variable-length array that contains the list of addresses. The address format is specific to the signaling protocol used by the call manager.
</DD>
</DL>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>The <B>AddressList</B> contains network addresses at which the local host can be reached. The <B>AddressList</B> returned to a particular client contains addresses that are common to all clients, as well as any addresses that the client itself has added to call manager's list of addresses with OID_CO_ADD_ADDRESS.</P>
