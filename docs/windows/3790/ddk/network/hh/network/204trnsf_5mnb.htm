<P>A connectionless miniport driver must not indicate a receive packet to a protocol driver while the miniport driver’s packet filter for that protocol driver is set to zero. When a miniport driver’s <I>MiniportInitialize</I> function is called, the miniport driver’s packet filter should be set to zero. When the packet filter is zero, receive indications are disabled. After a miniport driver’s <I>MiniportInitialize</I> function has returned, a protocol driver can set OID_GEN_CURRENT_PACKET_FILTER to a nonzero value, thereby enabling the miniport driver to indicate receive packets to that protocol. For more information on packet filters, see <A HREF="22genoid_4qgi.htm">OID_GEN_CURRENT_PACKET_FILTER</A>.</P>

<P>All miniport drivers must refrain from indicating receive packets when in a low-power (sleeping) state. For more information on miniport driver requirements for low-power states, see <A HREF="206pm_01d3.htm">Handling an OID_PNP_SET_POWER OID</A>.</P>
