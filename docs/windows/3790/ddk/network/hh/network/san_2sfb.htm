<P>A <I>system area network</I> (SAN) is a high-performance, connection-oriented network that can link a cluster of computers. A SAN delivers high bandwidth (1 Gbps or greater) with low latency. A SAN is typically switched by hubs that support eight or more nodes. The cable lengths between nodes on a SAN range from a few meters to a few kilometers. </P>

<P>Unlike existing network technologies such as Ethernet and ATM, a SAN offers a reliable transport service; that is, a SAN guarantees to deliver uncorrupted data in the same order in which it was sent. Connection endpoints in a SAN are not required to use the TCP/IP protocol stack to transfer data unless traffic must be routed between subnets. SAN-local communication can use a native SAN transport, bypassing the TCP/IP protocol stack. </P>

<P>A SAN network interface controller (NIC), a transport driver for the SAN NIC, or a combination of both exposes a private transport interface. However, because most networking applications are written to use TCP/IP through Windows® Sockets, they cannot use a SAN directly. The <A HREF="wsdp_6hnr.htm">Windows Sockets Direct</A> components shown in the following figure let these applications benefit from using a SAN transparently without requiring modification. Windows Sockets Direct is part of:

	<LI>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;2000 Advanced Server SP2</LI>

<P>The following figure shows the architecture required to support a SAN. The shaded areas represent components that a SAN NIC vendor supplies to enable using a SAN.</P>
