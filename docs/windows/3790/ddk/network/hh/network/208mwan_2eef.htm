<H2><A NAME="ddk_accepting_an_incoming_call_ng"></A>Accepting an Incoming Call</H2>

<P>After an NDIS WAN miniport driver has successfully completed an <A HREF="29tpioid_5ng2.htm">OID_TAPI_PROVIDER_INITIALIZE</A> request, an OID_TAPI_OPEN request, and an <A HREF="29tpioid_2dbm.htm">OID_TAPI_SET_DEFAULT_MEDIA_DETECTION</A>, it can receive an incoming call on the previously opened line. If the media type matches one it has been set to detect, the miniport driver should call <A HREF="103ndisx_5nn6.htm"><B>NdisMIndicateStatus</B></A> to notify upper layers of the offered call, passing NDIS_STATUS_TAPI_INDICATION as the <I>GeneralStatus</I>, and a pointer to the NDIS_TAPI_EVENT structure as the <I>StatusBuffer</I>. </P>

<P>The <B>ulMsg</B> member of NDIS_TAPI_EVENT is set to LINE_NEWCALL, and the <B>ulParam1</B> is set to <B>hdCall</B>, the driver-assigned handle for the call. The <B>htCall</B>, <B>ulParam2</B>, and <B>ulParam3</B> are set to zero. NDISTAPI will supply an <B>htCall</B> in <B>ulParam2</B> before returning from <B>NdisMIndicateStatus</B>. The miniport driver should retain this handle and use it in any subsequent indications pertaining to this call instance. For example, the miniport driver will supply this value as the <B>ConnectionWrapperID</B> when it indicates a line up to NDISWAN.</P>

<P>After the miniport driver has given a LINE_NEWCALL status indication, it should call <B>NdisMIndicateStatus</B>, with a LINECALLSTATE_<I>XXX</I> message, typically a LINECALLSTATE_OFFERING message. The <B>ulParam3</B> of this message is set with the media mode of the incoming call. </P>

<P>If the call is accepted by an application, <A HREF="101mini_7ng2.htm"><I>MiniportSetInformation</I></A> will be called with an <A HREF="29tpioid_7z3m.htm">OID_TAPI_ACCEPT</A> followed by an <A HREF="29tpioid_5jsi.htm">OID_TAPI_ANSWER</A> request or simply with an OID_TAPI_ANSWER request. </P>

<P>If the miniport driver receives an OID_TAPI_ACCEPT request, it should allocate and initialize a call-state context for the call, but it should not answer the call until it receives an answer request. Later, if it receives an OID_TAPI_ANSWER request, it should do the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Answer the call.</LI>

	<LI>Set the state of the line to connected and call <B>NdisMIndicateStatus</B> to report this new status if reporting of this status is enabled.</LI>
</UL>

<P>If the miniport driver receives an OID_TAPI_ANSWER request without first receiving an OID_TAPI_ACCEPT request, it should behave as if it had received both requests. </P>

<P>It is possible that a WAN NIC driver will never receive an OID_TAPI_ANSWER request or an OID_TAPI_ACCEPT request for an incoming call. This could occur when client applications are busy with other calls, or when clients are not interested in calls of the type indicated (for example, the media mode), and so forth. After waiting a certain amount of time for an answer or accept request or detecting that the remote party disconnected, the WAN NIC driver should notify the NDISTAPI driver that the call has transitioned to the idle state. Then, at some later time, an <A HREF="29tpioid_844y.htm">OID_TAPI_CLOSE_CALL</A> request will be sent to the WAN NIC driver to free up the call instance. It is also possible that after the miniport driver offers the incoming call, it will receive an OID_TAPI_CLOSE_CALL before it can time out the new call offer.</P>
