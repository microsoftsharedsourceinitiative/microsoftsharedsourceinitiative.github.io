<P>The TDI_CONNECTION_INFO structure defines the structure of the information returned for a TDI_QUERY_INFORMATION request in which <B>IrpSp-&gt;Parameters</B> is cast to a pointer to a TDI_REQUEST_KERNEL_QUERY_INFORMATION structure. The request sets the <B>QueryType</B> member of TDI_REQUEST_KERNEL_QUERY_INFORMATION to the TDI_QUERY_CONNECTION_INFO query type.</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>State</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the current state of the connection on the network. </DD>

<DT><B>Event</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the type of event the TDI driver most recently indicated to the client. The value is expressed as a TDI_EVENT_<I>XXX</I> code. </DD>

<DT><B>TransmittedTsdus</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of TSDUs transmitted on the connection endpoint.</DD>

<DT><B>ReceivedTsdus</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of TSDUs received on the connection endpoint.</DD>

<DT><B>TransmissionErrors</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of TSDUs that have had an error during transmission on the connection endpoint.</DD>

<DT><B>ReceiveErrors</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of TSDUs that have had an error during reception on the connection endpoint.</DD>

<DT><B>Throughput</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the estimated throughput on the connection, expressed in bytes per second, for sends and receives. Zero indicates that the driver cannot calculate the throughput.</DD>

<DT><B>Delay</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the estimated delay on the connection, expressed as a negative value. Delay, which is essentially constant regardless of packet size, affects the transmission time of each TSDU sent to the remote node.</DD>

<DT><B>SendBufferSize</B></DT>

<DD>If the transport buffers sends internally, specifies the size in bytes of its send buffer. Otherwise, this member is zero.</DD>

<DT><B>ReceiveBufferSize</B></DT>

<DD>If the transport buffers receives internally, specifies the size in bytes of its receive buffer. Otherwise, this member is zero.</DD>

<DT><B>Unreliable</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies TRUE if the transport determines that the connection has become unreliable. The transport is likely to send a disconnection event to its client if this member is TRUE, and sends or receives on this connection are likely to fail. 
</DD>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>A kernel-mode client that has opened a file object representing a connection with <B>ZwCreateFile</B> can make a query to determine the current state of its local connection. Such a client sets up an IRP with <B>TdiBuildQueryInformation</B>, passing in the <I>QType</I> TDI_QUERY_CONNECTION_INFO, and submits the IRP to the underlying transport to get this information. </P>

<P>TDI_CONNECTION_INFO defines the format in which the transport returns the requested information for such a query. </P>

<P>Until a client has established an endpoint-to-endpoint connection with a remote-node peer, only a subset of this information is potentially useful to the client, such as the <B>SendBufferSize</B> and <B>ReceiveBufferSize</B> of an underlying transport that supports internal buffering. A TDI transport can simply return its default or initialization values for members that are not yet relevant or even fail the query-information request if an endpoint-to-endpoint connection is not yet established. </P>

<P>Consequently, kernel-mode clients usually submit this request to their transports after making an endpoint-to-endpoint connection with a remote-node peer. For example, the client can estimate the transmission time for sends over the network using the <B>Delay</B> and <B>Throughput</B> values returned for this query, assuming the underlying transport does not return a zero for either. The estimated time to transmit a TSDU of size <I>n</I> bytes can be calculated as <I>SendTime</I> = <B>Delay</B> + (<I>n</I> * <B>Throughput</B>). </P>
