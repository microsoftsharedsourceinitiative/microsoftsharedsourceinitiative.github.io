<P>A network wake-up event is an external event that causes a NIC to wake the system. A NIC wakes the system by asserting a bus-specific wake-up signal that eventually results in the system making a transition from a sleeping state to the working state.</P>

<P>NDIS defines the following two network wake-up events:

<OL>
	<LI>Receipt of a network wake-up frame that contains a pattern that was specified by a bound protocol driver.</LI>

	<LI>Receipt of a Magic Packet.</LI>
</OL>

<P>After a miniport driver completes initialization, both NDIS and bound protocol drivers can query the miniport driver with <A HREF="212pnpoid_5j02.htm">OID_PNP_CAPABILITIES</A> to determine the wake-up capabilities of the miniport driver's NIC. A NIC can support any combination of network wake-up events, including none at all. NDIS treats the miniport driver as power management-aware if the miniport driver returns NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS in response to a query of OID_PNP_CAPABILITIES. This is true regardless of the wake-up capabilities that the miniport driver reported.</P>

<P>Depending on the capabilities of the NIC, a network wake-up event can occur from any device power state, including the highest-powered state, D0. </P>

<H4>Network Wake-Up Frames</H4>

<P>If a miniport driver, in its response to an <A HREF="212pnpoid_5j02.htm">OID_PNP_CAPABILITIES</A> query, indicates that its NIC can signal a wake-up on the receipt of a packet that contains a specified pattern, a bound protocol can enable network wake-up frames for the NIC and specify wake-up patterns. To enable this type of wake-up, a protocol driver sets the NDIS_PNP_WAKE_UP_PATTERN_MATCH flag in <A HREF="212pnpoid_58fm.htm">OID_PNP_ENABLE_WAKE_UP</A>.</P>

<P>A protocol driver uses <A HREF="212pnpoid_8lwy.htm">OID_PNP_ADD_WAKE_UP_PATTERN</A> to specify a wake-up pattern, along with a mask that indicates which bytes of an incoming packet should be compared with the pattern. A protocol driver can remove a wake-up pattern with <A HREF="212pnpoid_9q7m.htm">OID_PNP_REMOVE_WAKE_UP_PATTERN</A>.</P>

<H4>Magic-Packet Wake-Up</H4>

<P>A Magic Packet is a packet that contains 16 contiguous copies of the receiving NIC's MAC address.</P>
