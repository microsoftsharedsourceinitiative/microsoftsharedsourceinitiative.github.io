<P>Driver developers should designate code as pageable whenever possible, freeing system space for code that must be memory-resident. Mark functions as pageable with the <A HREF="103ndisx_5svm.htm">NDIS_PAGEABLE_FUNCTION</A> macro. The IRQL, resource management features, and other characteristics of the function might prohibit the function from being pageable.</P>

<P>Every <I>ProtocolXxx</I> function runs at an IRQL in the range from PASSIVE_LEVEL to DISPATCH_LEVEL. Functions that run exclusively at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL should be marked as pageable. </P>

<P>A driver function that runs at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL can be made pageable as long as it neither calls nor is called by any function that runs at IRQL &gt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL — such as a function that acquires a spin lock. Acquiring a spin lock causes the IRQL of the acquiring thread to be raised to DISPATCH_LEVEL. A driver function, such as <A HREF="104tdlow_2bqq.htm"><I>ProtocolBindAdapter</I></A>, that runs at IRQL&nbsp;=&nbsp;PASSIVE_LEVEL must not call any <B>Ndis</B><I>Xxx</I> functions that run at IRQL &gt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL if that driver function is marked as pageable code. See <A HREF="102nsmry_6i9e.htm">NDIS Library Functions</A><I>,</I> which specifies the IRQL for each <B>Ndis</B><I>Xxx</I> function. </P>

<P>The <A HREF="104tdlow_9raq.htm"><B>DriverEntry</B> of NDIS protocol drivers</A>, as well as code that is called only from <B>DriverEntry</B>, should be specified as initialization-only code, using the <A HREF="103ndisx_1qia.htm">NDIS_INIT_FUNCTION</A> macro. Code identified with this macro is assumed to only run once at system initialization time, and, as a result, is only mapped during that time. After a function marked as initialization-only returns, it is discarded.</P>
