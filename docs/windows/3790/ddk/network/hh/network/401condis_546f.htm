<H3><A NAME="ddk_connection_oriented_operations_performed_by_clients_ng"></A>Connection-Oriented Operations Performed by Clients</H3>

<P>A connection-oriented client performs the following connection-oriented operations:

<UL>
	<LI><B>Opens and closes an address family</B>
<P>On receiving notification from NDIS that a call manager or MCM driver has registered an address family, a connection-oriented driver can open that address family with the call manager or MCM driver (see <A HREF="401condis_4grr.htm">Registering and Opening an Address Family</A>). The client can then use the call manager services provided by the call manager or MCM driver. A client releases the association between itself and a call manager or MCM driver by closing the address family (see <A HREF="401condis_1lk7.htm">Closing an Address Family</A>). 
</LI>

	<LI><B>Registers and deregisters SAPs</B>
<P>After opening an address family with a call manager or an MCM driver, a connection-oriented client can register one or more SAPs with the call manager or MCM driver (see <A HREF="401condis_03qf.htm">Registering a SAP</A>). The call manager or MCM driver will then indicate to the client any incoming calls addressed to the registered SAP(s). A client releases a SAP by deregistering it (see <A HREF="401condis_4jfr.htm">Deregistering a SAP</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Adds and deletes PVCs</B>
<P>A connection-oriented client can monitor when an operator manually configures or deconfigures a permanent VC (PVC). In response to such an action, the client can request a call manager or MCM driver to add a PVC to its list of configured PVCs or to delete a PVC from such a list (see <A HREF="211cooid_9h0y.htm">OID_CO_ADD_PVC</A> and <A HREF="211cooid_8n3m.htm">OID_CO_DELETE_PVC</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Makes outgoing calls</B>
<P>Before making an outgoing call, a client must initiate the creation of a VC for the call (see <A HREF="401condis_0t47.htm">Creating a VC</A>). A client can then make an outgoing call (see <A HREF="401condis_69yf.htm">Making a Call</A>). To make a point-to-multipoint call, a client specifies a party when making the call.
</LI>

	<LI><B>Adds a party to or drops a party from a point-to-multipoint call</B>
<P>A client can add a party to a point-to-multipoint call (see <A HREF="401condis_184n.htm">Adding a Party to a Multipoint Call</A>) and delete a party from a point-to-multipoint call (see <A HREF="401condis_8wo7.htm">Dropping a Party from a Multipoint Call</A>). A client can also respond to an incoming request to drop a party from a point-to-multipoint call (see <A HREF="401condis_5exz.htm">Request to Drop a Party from a Multipoint Call</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Accepts or rejects an incoming call</B>
<P>A client can accept or reject an incoming call addressed to a SAP that the client previously registered with a call manager or MCM driver (see <A HREF="401condis_3tyf.htm">Indicating an Incoming Call</A>). 
</LI>

	<LI><B>Negotiates the call parameters for an active VC</B>
<P>Depending on what is allowed by the signaling protocol, a client can negotiate the call parameters for an active VC. A client can request a change in Quality of Service (QoS) (see <A HREF="401condis_1j6v.htm">Client-Initiated Request to Change Call Parameters</A>) and respond to an incoming request to change the QoS for an active VC. A client can also respond to a request from the remote party to change the QoS for a call (see <A HREF="401condis_16qv.htm">Incoming Request to Change Call Parameters</A>). 
</LI>

	<LI><B>Sends and receives packets</B>
<P>A client can send packets through a connection-oriented miniport driver or MCM driver (see <A HREF="401condis_3z3b.htm">Sending Packets on a VC</A>). A client can also receive packets through a connection-oriented miniport driver or MCM driver (see <A HREF="401condis_5yw7.htm">Receiving Packets on a VC</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Initiates the deletion of a VC</B>
<P>A client can initiate the deletion of a VC that it created (see <A HREF="401condis_3d2f.htm">Deleting a VC</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Initiates the tear-down of a call</B>
<P>A client can initiate the tear-down of a outgoing call that it made or an incoming call that it accepted (see <A HREF="401condis_3i07.htm">Client-Initiated Request to Close a Call</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Queries or sets information</B>
<P>A client can query or set information maintained by a bound call manager or the call manager portion of an MCM driver. A client can also respond to queries and sets from a bound call manager or MCM driver (see <A HREF="401condis_9sdj.htm">Querying or Setting Information</A>).

<P>In addition, a client can query or set information maintained by a bound miniport driver or the miniport driver portion of a bound MCM driver (see <A HREF="401condis_9sdj.htm">Querying or Setting Information</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Inputs miniport driver status indications</B>
<P>A client can input status indicated by a connection-oriented miniport driver or an MCM driver (see <A HREF="401condis_33s7.htm">Indicating Miniport Driver Status</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Resets a NIC</B>
<P>A connection-oriented client can cause a connection-oriented miniport driver or MCM driver to reset its NIC (see <A HREF="401condis_86eg.htm">Reset</A>).
