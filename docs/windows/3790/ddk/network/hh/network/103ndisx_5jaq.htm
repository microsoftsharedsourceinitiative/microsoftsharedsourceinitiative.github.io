<DD>Pointer to a UNICODE_STRING structure that specifies the string containing the name of a routine.</DD>

<H4>Return Value</H4>

<P>Returns the address of the routine whose name is specified at <I>NdisRoutineName</I> if the routine is available; otherwise, NULL.</P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>An NDIS driver can use <B>NdisGetRoutineAddress</B> to obtain the address of an exported NDIS routine. The driver can then use this address to call the NDIS routine. </P>

<P>An NDIS driver can use <B>NdisGetRoutineAddress</B> if the driver must remain backward compatible. For example, if such a driver imports an NDIS routine that is not exported by the version of NDIS that is currently running, the I/O manager will not load the driver on the operating system. However, the driver can first use <B>NdisGetRoutineAddress</B> to determine if the routine is available in the version of NDIS that is currently running. If available, the address of the routine is returned; the driver can then use the address to call the routine. If not available, NULL is returned; the driver cannot call the routine, but the driver still loads on the operating system. </P>

<P>No performance improvement is gained by using the address that is returned by <B>NdisGetRoutineAddress</B> rather than calling the specified routine by name. Therefore, do not write an NDIS driver to use <B>NdisGetRoutineAddress</B> if you know that the NDIS version with which the driver will run exports the specified routine. </P>

<P>System support for <B>NdisGetRoutineAddress</B> is available in Windows XP and later versions.</P>

<P>Callers of <B>NdisGetRoutineAddress</B> run at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL. Typically, an NDIS driver calls <B>NdisGetRoutineAddress</B> in its <B>DriverEntry</B> routine.</P>
