<P>The OID_WW_TAC_SEND_COMMAND OID requests the miniport driver to send a command to the DataTAC NIC using Native Control Language (NCL). The calling protocol formats the NCL command for the Service Data Unit (SDU) as described in DataTAC Open Protocol Specifications Native Control Language Release 1.2. Use of this OID is not recommended if an equivalent OID_WW_TAC_XXX object exists.</P>

<P>This request uses a WW_TAC_SEND_COMMAND structure, defined as equivalent to the <A HREF="210wlsod_7sky.htm">NDIS_VAR_DATA_DESC</A> structure, which was defined previously. At most, the information supplied in this buffer can be 2048 bytes in length. </P>

<P>The miniport driver maintains its own copy of the SDU token that was previously returned to the protocol through the <A HREF="210wlsod_1tgy.htm">OID_WW_TAC_UNIQUE_SDU_TAG</A> request. The miniport driver transfers the NCL command for the SDU to the NIC. Upon completion of the command, the miniport driver then retrieves the response and makes the response available through a subsequent <A HREF="210wlsod_6lwy.htm">OID_WW_TAC_GET_RESPONSE</A> request. </P>

<P>Queries and indications are irrelevant for this OID.</P>
