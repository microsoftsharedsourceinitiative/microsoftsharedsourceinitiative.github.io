<P>The following figure shows how a kernel-mode client closes a connection endpoint.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/426-11.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><B>Closing a Local-Node Connection Endpoint</B></P>

<P>After an endpoint-to-endpoint connection has been disconnected, as already described in <A HREF="305toper_7lnr.htm">Disconnecting an Endpoint-to-Endpoint Connection</A>, a client can close the connection endpoint. </P>

<P>When a client no longer has any use for an open connection endpoint, it <I>must</I> close that connection endpoint as follows:

<UL>
	<LI>Pass the file object pointer returned by <B>ObReferenceObjectByHandle</B> to <B>ObDereferenceObject</B>.</LI>

	<LI>Pass the file handle that was returned by <B>ZwCreateFile</B> when the connection endpoint was opened to <B>ZwClose</B>. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Then, the I/O Manager submits IRPs to the transport’s <A HREF="31tddisp_3vn6.htm">TdiDispatchCleanup</A> and, subsequently, <A HREF="31tddisp_7t9u.htm">TdiDispatchClose</A> routines.</P>

<P>These transport routines immediately close the connection endpoint and free all associated transport driver resources. TdiDispatchCleanup also terminates any active connection involved with the endpoint by sending a disconnect notification to the corresponding remote-node transport.</P>

<P>As the preceding sentence implies, it is unnecessary for a TDI client to disassociate the connection endpoint from its associated transport address before making a close-connection-endpoint request. If necessary, the underlying transport driver simulates the effects of a disassociation. </P>

<P>However, a client can explicitly disassociate a connection endpoint from an open transport address before closing the connection endpoint by making a <A HREF="32ioctl_31ma.htm">TDI_DISSOCIATE_ADDRESS</A> request to the transport, set up with <A HREF="34bldmac_1376.htm"><B>TdiBuildDisassociateAddress</B></A>. </P>

<P>For example, a client might make a disassociate-address request and reassociate the open connection endpoint with another open transport address. </P>
