<P>All I/O requests are directed to an open file object, which can represent a physical or virtual device, a data file, or any logical target of I/O requests, that can be opened by a particular process. Open file objects are process-specific. For example, the I/O Manager creates a file object for each process that opens a particular data file. </P>

<P>TDI uses file objects to represent entities that exist in <I>any</I> network communication environment. In particular, TDI uses file objects to represent the following types of TDI-defined entities:

<UL>
	<LI>To represent transport addresses opened by specific processes or groups of processes on a network node. For more information, see <A HREF="303tdi_1uuf.htm">File Objects Represent Transport Addresses</A>.</LI>

	<LI>To represent connection endpoints identifying specific endpoints associated with particular transport addresses, opened to set up endpoint-to-endpoint connections with remote-node peer processes. For more information, see <A HREF="303tdi_72sn.htm">File Objects Represent Connection Endpoints</A>.</LI>

	<LI>To represent control channels identifying transport providers, opened for the purpose of setting and querying global configuration, features, limits, or statistics information maintained by the underlying transport. For more information, see <A HREF="303tdi_2u07.htm">File Objects Represent Control Channels</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>A TDI transport driver and the underlying NDIS drivers provide a mechanism by which data can be transferred from a process on one network node to one or more processes that reside either on<I> </I>the same node or<I> </I>other<I> </I>network nodes. The preceding address and connection endpoint entities represented by open file objects are the means by which such transfers occur. </P>

<P>For example, the redirector process for Windows®&nbsp;2000 and later versions opens two file objects, one representing a transport address and the other a connection endpoint associated with that address, to send SMB (Server Message Block) messages to a server process on a remote node and to receive messages back from the server process on the remote node.</P>
