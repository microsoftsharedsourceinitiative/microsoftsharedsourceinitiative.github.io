<P>NDIS uses a software object called a <I>logical adapter</I> to represent each NIC in the system. This object is maintained by NDIS and is opaque to the miniport driver and to protocol drivers. NDIS passes a handle to this structure to the NIC driver's <I>MiniportInitialize</I> function. The miniport driver subsequently supplies this handle in all calls to <B>Ndis</B><I>Xxx</I> functions that pertain to the NIC designated by the handle. </P>

<P>When a miniport driver is called to initialize a NIC it manages, it creates its own internal data structure to represent the NIC. The driver uses this structure, referred to as the miniport driver adapter context, to maintain device-specific state information it needs to manage the NIC. The driver passes a handle to this structure to NDIS when its <I>MiniportInitialize</I> function calls <A HREF="103ndisx_175e.htm"><B>NdisMSetAttributes</B></A> or <A HREF="103ndisx_1pmb.htm"><B>NdisMSetAttributesEx</B></A>. When NDIS calls one of the miniport driver’s <I>MiniportXxx</I> functions that pertains to the NIC, it passes this handle to identify the correct NIC to the driver. The miniport driver adapter context is owned and maintained by the miniport driver and is opaque to NDIS and to protocol drivers.</P>
