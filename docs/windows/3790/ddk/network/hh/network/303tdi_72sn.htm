<P>A file object that represents an open connection endpoint identifies a specific connection on which local and remote-node peer processes are communicating with each other across the network or will communicate with each other when the local-node process has established an endpoint-to-endpoint connection with a remote-node peer. </P>

<P>Any such file object must be associated with another open file object that represents a particular transport address. The transport address identifies the process, as already described in <A HREF="303tdi_1uuf.htm">File Objects Represent Transport Addresses</A>. </P>

<P>In a similar manner, the transport uses the file object representing the local connection endpoint to maintain state about the remote-node peer process, such as the remote-node transport address, with which its local-node client establishes an endpoint-to-endpoint connection. </P>

<P>A client process can establish many endpoint-to-endpoint connections between itself and other processes on remote nodes. For example, the redirector establishes separate connections between itself and each remote server for Windows&nbsp;2000 and later with which it communicates. Such a client can have several open connection endpoints all separately associated with an open transport address. </P>

<P>A process cannot send data over an endpoint-to-endpoint connection unless it has a means of identifying which of all existing connections the data is to be sent over. Each open file object that represents a connection endpoint is used to discriminate among established endpoint-to-endpoint connections of the same process. </P>
