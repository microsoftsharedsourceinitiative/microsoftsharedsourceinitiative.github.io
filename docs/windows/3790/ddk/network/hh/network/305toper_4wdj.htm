<P>The following figure shows how a kernel-mode client opens a connection endpoint in its underlying transport driver.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/426-03.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><B>Opening a Connection Endpoint</B></P>

<P>If a local-node client requires connection-oriented communication with a remote-node peer process, the local-node client must first open a transport address and then open a connection endpoint in its underlying transport. The client makes two calls to <B>ZwCreateFile</B>, first to open an address and, then, a connection endpoint. </P>

<P>When opening a connection endpoint, the client passes a client-supplied context for the connection in the EA (extended attributes) buffer parameter to <B>ZwCreateFile</B>. Within the EA buffer, the client sets the <B>EaName</B> member to the system-defined value <B>TdiConnectionContext</B> followed by an EA value that is usually the address of a client-allocated context area in which the client will subsequently maintain state about the endpoint-to-endpoint connection to be established. </P>

<P>The client's call to <B>ZwCreateFile</B> causes the I/O Manager to create a client-process-specific file object to represent the connection endpoint and to call the TDI transport driver’s <A HREF="31tddisp_6foy.htm">TdiDispatchCreate</A> routine with an IRP containing the client-supplied parameters to <B>ZwCreateFile</B>. TdiDispatchCreate parses the EA information, and the transport sets up internal state for the open connection endpoint of this client if the call succeeds. </P>

<P>After its successful call to <B>ZwCreateFile</B> returns a file handle to the client and the client has obtained a pointer to the file object with <B>ObReferenceObjectByHandle</B>, it is ready to make certain TDI_<I>XXX</I> IOCTL requests to the underlying transport to establish an endpoint-to-endpoint connection with a remote-node peer. </P>

<P>First, the client must associate the connection endpoint with its open transport address by submitting a <A HREF="32ioctl_2epe.htm">TDI_ASSOCIATE_ADDRESS</A> request, set up with <A HREF="34bldmac_72ia.htm"><B>TdiBuildAssociateAddress</B></A>, to its underlying transport. </P>

<P>For more information about setting up TDI_<I>XXX</I> IOCTL IRPs, see <A HREF="305toper_1aav.htm">Packaging and Submitting IOCTL Requests</A>, next. For more information about how to establish an endpoint-to-endpoint connection, see <A HREF="305toper_8up3.htm">Making an Endpoint-to-Endpoint Connection</A>. </P>

<P>When the endpoint-to-endpoint connection has been disconnected and the client no longer will use any connection-oriented communications, the client must close the connection endpoint by passing the file handle that was returned by <B>ZwCreateFile</B> to <B>ZwClose</B>, as described later in <A HREF="305toper_5ujr.htm">Closing a Connection Endpoint</A>. </P>
