<P>The OID_WW_GEN_SIM_EXCEPTION OID requests an underlying miniport driver to return information that specifies status for various SIM-related conditions. The following lists the valid status values from the WW_GEN_SIM_EXCEPTION enumeration. This OID is defined as OPTIONAL.

<DL>
<DT>SIM_STATUS_OK</DT>

<DD>No known error conditions related to the SIM.</DD>

<DT>SIM_STATUS_ERROR</DT>

<DD>General SIM-related failure. A status error of this type indicates that possibly the NIC's SIM should be returned for service.</DD>

<DT>SIM_STATUS_MISSING</DT>

<DD>The SIM is not inserted in the NIC but is required to access the NIC's services.</DD>

<DT>SIM_STATUS_NO_RESPONSE</DT>

<DD>The SIM is inserted in the NIC but not responding to requests. A status error of this type indicates that possibly the NIC's SIM should be returned for service.</DD>

<DT>SIM_STATUS_REMOVED</DT>

<DD>The SIM has been detached from the NIC.</DD>

<DT>SIM_STATUS_CRYPT_ERROR</DT>

<DD>The contents of the SIM is corrupt. A status error of this type indicates that possibly the SIM is defective or has been tampered with. The SIM should be returned for service. </DD>

<DT>SIM_STATUS_AUTH_ERROR</DT>

<DD>Authentication for the SIM has failed. A status error of this type indicates that possibly the SIM is defective or has been tampered with. The SIM should be returned for service. </DD>

<DT>SIM_STATUS_NEED_PIN</DT>

<DD>The SIM requires a PIN before access to the NIC’s services is granted. </DD>

<DT>SIM_STATUS_NEED_PUK</DT>

<DD>The SIM requires a PUK to reset the number of retry attempts that are available to protocols and applications to enter the correct PIN into the SIM. A status error of this type indicates that entry of a PIN into the SIM has exceeded the available number of attempts. For more information, see <A HREF="210wlsod_327m.htm">OID_WW_GEN_SIM_STATUS</A> and <A HREF="210wlsod_6sj6.htm">OID_WW_GEN_SIM_PUK</A>. </DD>

<DT>SIM_STATUS_WRONG</DT>

<DD>A SIM is inserted in the NIC but is the incorrect SIM for the NIC. That is, this particular type of SIM is not compatible with the NIC.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>Queries with this OID return the most recently recorded SIM-related condition. If any bound protocol has enabled indications with <A HREF="210wlsod_2qr6.htm">OID_WW_GEN_INDICATION_REQUEST</A>, the miniport driver must call <A HREF="103ndisx_5nn6.htm"><B>NdisMIndicateStatus</B></A> to notify such protocol(s) if any SIM operation generates one of the status conditions in the WW_GEN_SIM_EXCEPTION enumeration. It can ignore the <B>TriggerValue</B> member that was specified in the OID_WW_GEN_INDICATION_REQUEST. </P>

<P>Sets are irrelevant for this OID. </P>
