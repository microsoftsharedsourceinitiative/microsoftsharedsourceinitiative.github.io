<P>In addition to controlling NIC hardware, a connection-oriented miniport driver performs the following connection-oriented functions:

<UL>
	<LI><B>Sends and receives packets</B>
<P>A connection-oriented miniport driver sends and receives packets on behalf of connection-oriented clients or call managers (see <A HREF="401condis_3z3b.htm">Sending Packets on a VC</A> and <A HREF="401condis_5yw7.htm">Receiving Packets on a VC</A>). 
</LI>

	<LI><B>Creates (sets up) VCs</B>
<P>At the request of a connection-oriented client, a connection-oriented miniport driver allocates and initializes the resources for a VC for an outgoing call (see <A HREF="401condis_0t47.htm">Creating a VC</A>). At the request of a call manager, a connection-oriented miniport driver allocates and initializes the resources for a VC for an incoming call or on which the call manager will send and/or receive signaling messages (see <A HREF="401condis_0t47.htm">Creating a VC</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Activates VCs</B>
<P>At the request of a call manager, a connection-oriented miniport driver communicates with its NIC to prepare the NIC to receive or transmit data across a VC (see <A HREF="401condis_1wx3.htm">Activating a VC</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Deactivates VCs</B>
<P>At the request of a call manager, a connection-oriented miniport driver communicates with its NIC to terminate all communication across a VC (see <A HREF="401condis_3dyf.htm">Deactivating a VC</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Deletes VCs</B>
<P>At the request of a connection-oriented client, a connection-oriented miniport driver deallocates the resources for a VC whose creation was initiated by that client (see <A HREF="401condis_3d2f.htm">Deleting a VC</A>). At the request of a call manager, a connection-oriented miniport driver deallocates the resources for a VC whose creation was initiated by that call manager (see <A HREF="401condis_3d2f.htm">Deleting a VC</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Responds to information queries or sets </B>
<P>A connection-oriented miniport driver responds to query and set operations by a bound connection-oriented client or call manager (see <A HREF="401condis_9sdj.htm">Querying or Setting Information</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Indicates status</B>
<P>A connection-oriented miniport driver can indicate changes in its status or the status of its NIC to bound connection-oriented clients and call managers (see <A HREF="401condis_33s7.htm">Indicating Miniport Driver Status</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Resets the NIC</B>
<P>At the request of a connection-oriented client, call manager, or NDIS, a connection-oriented miniport driver resets its NIC (see <A HREF="401condis_86eg.htm">Reset</A>).
</LI>
