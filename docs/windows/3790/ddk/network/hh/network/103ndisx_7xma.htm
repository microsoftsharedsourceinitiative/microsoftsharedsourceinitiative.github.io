<P>NDIS_GET_ORIGINAL_PACKET returns a pointer to a packet descriptor that the lowest-level driver in a layered stack of NDIS drivers indicated. The calling driver should access the out-of-band (OOB) data block from this original packet rather than the packet that the driver below the calling driver indicated. If the calling driver is not part of a layered stack, the returned packet descriptor will be identical to the packet that the driver below the calling driver indicated. </P>

<H4>Return Value</H4>

<P>NDIS_GET_ORIGINAL_PACKET returns a pointer to the packet descriptor that the lowest-level driver in a layered stack of NDIS drivers indicated, or if the calling driver is not part of a layered stack, NDIS_GET_ORIGINAL_PACKET returns the packet descriptor that the driver below the calling driver indicated. </P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>Typically, the packet that is returned by NDIS_GET_ORIGINAL_PACKET is the same packet that was indicated up by the driver below the calling driver. To indicate packets to a higher-level driver, a driver can call, for example, the <A HREF="103ndisx_5uuq.htm"><B>NdisMIndicateReceivePacket</B></A> function. To retrieve packets that were indicated up from a lower-level driver, a driver can call the <A HREF="103ndisx_4faq.htm"><B>NdisGetReceivedPacket</B></A> function. </P>

<P>To obtain a pointer to a packet that was indicated up by the lowest-level driver in a layered stack of NDIS drivers, protocol and intermediate drivers call NDIS_GET_ORIGINAL_PACKET. In this call, they pass the pointer to the received packet. Using this call, each driver in the layered stack can access the OOB data block that is associated with packets that are received from the network without requiring that packets be copied to each layer.</P>

<P>Callers of this macro can be running at any IRQL.</P>

<H4>Example</H4>

<P>The following example code retrieves a packet that was received from the driver below and obtains the original packet from the retrieved packet. </P>

<PRE>// Get the original packet, which could be the received packet 
// or the packet originating from the lowest-level driver. 
// This result is based on the number of layered drivers in the stack. 
//
Pkt = NdisGetReceivedPacket(BindingHandle, MacReceiveContext);
OrigPkt = NDIS_GET_ORIGINAL_PACKET(Pkt);</PRE>
