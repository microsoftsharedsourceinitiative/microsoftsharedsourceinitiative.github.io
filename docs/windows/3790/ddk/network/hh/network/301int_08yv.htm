<P>An intermediate driver unbinds from an underlying miniport driver by calling <A HREF="103ndisx_27ea.htm"><B>NdisCloseAdapter</B></A> from its <A HREF="104tdlow_1l6a.htm"><I>ProtocolUnbindAdapter</I></A> function. NDIS calls <I>ProtocolUnbindAdapter</I> if the underlying NIC is no longer available. </P>

<P>An intermediate driver's <I>ProtocolUnbindAdapter</I> function<B> </B>might be called when the driver has an outstanding call to <A HREF="103ndisx_0jn6.htm"><B>NdisIMInitializeDeviceInstanceEx</B></A>. This situation occurs when NDIS has not yet called <A HREF="101mini_9jzm.htm"><I>MiniportInitialize</I></A>to initialize the corresponding virtual miniports. In this case, the intermediate driver must call <A HREF="103ndisx_8nhu.htm"><B>NdisIMCancelInitializeDeviceInstance</B></A> to attempt to cancel the initialization of these virtual miniports.</P>

<P>If the underlying miniport driver binding that is being closed is mapped to a device exported by the intermediate driver, and if that device was initialized by calling <A HREF="103ndisx_0jn6.htm"><B>NdisIMInitializeDeviceInstanceEx</B></A>, the intermediate driver can call <A HREF="103ndisx_1q7m.htm"><B>NdisIMDeInitializeDeviceInstance</B></A> to close the device. The result is that the intermediate driver's virtual miniport becomes no longer available for sends or requests made by higher-level drivers. </P>

<P>After an intermediate driver calls <B>NdisCloseAdapter</B>, it should fail any send requests for that binding with an appropriate error status. </P>
