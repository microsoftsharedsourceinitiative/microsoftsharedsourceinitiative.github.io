<P>When WMI sends a query or set to a miniport driver (that is, when WMI sends an IRP to a functional device object created by NDIS), NDIS intercepts the query or set, maps the GUID to an OID supported by the miniport driver, and then queries or sets the miniport driver-maintained OID. If the miniport driver is a connectionless miniport driver, NDIS calls the miniport driver's <A HREF="101mini_2vw2.htm"><I>MiniportQueryInformation</I></A> function or <A HREF="101mini_7ng2.htm"><I>MiniportSetInformation</I></A> function. If the miniport driver is a connection-oriented miniport driver, NDIS calls the miniport driver's <A HREF="101mini_0pgy.htm"><I>MiniportCoRequest</I></A> function. NDIS returns to WMI the results of the query or set to the miniport driver OID.</P>

<P>If a miniport driver makes a status indication with <B>NdisM(Co)IndicateStatus</B> that a WMI client has registered to receive, NDIS maps that indication to a GUID, and passes the status indication to WMI. WMI then passes the status indication to all its clients that have registered to be notified of the indication.</P>
