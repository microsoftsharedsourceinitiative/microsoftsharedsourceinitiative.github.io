<DL>
<DT><B>Errors</B></DT>

<DD>A 32-bit value that specifies a bitmask that is set with one or more of the following system-defined values to indicate why the fragment was received. The miniport driver can set a combination of the following values, using the binary OR operator: 

<DL>
<DT>WAN_ERROR_CRC</DT>

<DD>Specifies a CRC error was encountered for a particular VC. CRC errors are caused by the failure of a cyclic redundancy check. A CRC error indicates that one or more bytes in a frame received were found garbled on arrival.</DD>

<DT>WAN_ERROR_FRAMING</DT>

<DD>Specifies a framing error was encountered for a particular VC. A framing error occurs when an asynchronous byte is received with an invalid start or stop bit. </DD>

<DT>WAN_ERROR_HARDWAREOVERRUN</DT>

<DD>Specifies a hardware overrun was encountered for a particular VC. Hardware overruns occur when the WAN NIC cannot handle the rate at which data is received. </DD>

<DT>WAN_ERROR_BUFFEROVERRUN</DT>

<DD>Specifies a buffer overrun was encountered for a particular VC. Buffer overruns occur when the WAN miniport driver cannot handle the rate at which data is received. </DD>

<DT>WAN_ERROR_TIMEOUT</DT>

<DD>Specifies a time-out error was encountered for a particular VC. Time-out errors occur when an expected byte is not received in time. </DD>

<DT>WAN_ERROR_ALIGNMENT</DT>

<DD>Specifies an alignment error was encountered for a particular VC. Alignment errors occur when a byte received is different from the byte expected. This typically happens when a byte is lost or when a time-out error occurs. </DD>
</DL>


<P>If no direct mapping from the WAN medium error to one of the preceding error flags exists, choose the most appropriate flag or combination of flags.

<P>A CoNDIS WAN miniport driver calls <A HREF="103ndisx_0qgi.htm"><B>NdisMCoIndicateStatus</B></A> with this type of indication when it receives a partial packet from an endpoint of a virtual connection on the wide area network.  </P>
