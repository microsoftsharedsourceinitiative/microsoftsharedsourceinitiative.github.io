<P>A CoNDIS WAN miniport driver calls <A HREF="103ndisx_0qgi.htm"><B>NdisMCoIndicateStatus</B></A> to indicate status changes up to bound protocol drivers. For more information about indicating status from a CoNDIS miniport driver or MCM, see <A HREF="401condis_33s7.htm">Indicating Miniport Driver Status</A>.</P>

<P>Bound protocol drivers can ignore these status indications. However, processing these indications typically results in improved performance for protocol drivers and the miniport driver. </P>

<P>The NDISWAN intermediate driver forwards status indications to NDIS. NDIS calls the <A HREF="104tdlow_3khe.htm"><I>ProtocolCoStatus</I></A> functions of bound protocols or a configuration manager. These protocols or configuration manager can log these indications and possibly take corrective action, if necessary. </P>

<P>For a CoNDIS WAN miniport driver, a call to <A HREF="103ndisx_0qgi.htm"><B>NdisMCoIndicateStatus</B></A> is the same as in any CoNDIS miniport driver, except that the CoNDIS WAN miniport driver indicates a WAN-specific status for each VC on the miniport driver's NIC. The miniport driver calls <B>NdisMCoIndicateStatus</B> with an explicit VC handle to indicate these changes up to a protocol driver that shares this VC. If the driver specifies a NULL <I>NdisVcHandle</I>, the status pertains to a general change in the state of the NIC.</P>

<P>Each status indication provides two basic pieces of information:

<UL>
	<LI>A status code that specifies the general status. There are a limited number of defined general status codes; this list is subject to future expansion.</LI>

	<LI>A buffer that contains the status information. This status information can be specific to a NIC, or, for a CoNDIS WAN miniport driver, specific to a VC on a NIC. For example, a buffer might contain the new transmit speed of an X.25 connection, which recently decreased by a factor of two. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The CoNDIS WAN VC status indications are: 

<UL>
	<LI>NDIS_STATUS_WAN_CO_LINKPARAMS 
<P>A CoNDIS WAN miniport driver calls <A HREF="103ndisx_0qgi.htm"><B>NdisMCoIndicateStatus</B></A> to indicate that the parameters for a particular VC that is active on the NIC have changed. In this call, the miniport driver passes the handle to the VC in the <I>NdisVcHandle</I> parameter, NDIS_STATUS_WAN_CO_LINKPARAMS in the <I>GeneralStatus</I> parameter, and a pointer to a <A HREF="105nstru_5hma.htm">WAN_CO_LINKPARAMS</A> structure in the <I>StatusBuffer</I> parameter. WAN_CO_LINKPARAMS describes new parameters for the VC. 
</LI>

	<LI>NDIS_STATUS_WAN_CO_FRAGMENT <BR>
A CoNDIS WAN miniport driver calls <B>NdisMCoIndicateStatus</B> to indicate that it has received a partial packet from the endpoint of a VC. In this call, the miniport driver passes the handle to the VC in the <I>NdisVcHandle</I> parameter, NDIS_STATUS_WAN_CO_FRAGMENT in the <I>GeneralStatus</I> parameter, and a pointer to an <A HREF="105nstru_7zoy.htm">NDIS_WAN_CO_FRAGMENT</A> structure in the <I>StatusBuffer</I> parameter. NDIS_WAN_CO_FRAGMENT describes the reason that the partial packet was received.
<P>After this indication occurs, a connection-oriented client should send frames to the connection-oriented client at the other end of the VC. These frames will notify the opposite endpoint of the partial-packet situation, so that the opposite endpoint is not required to wait for a time-out to occur.

<P>NDISWAN monitors dropped packets by counting the number of fragment indications on each VC.
