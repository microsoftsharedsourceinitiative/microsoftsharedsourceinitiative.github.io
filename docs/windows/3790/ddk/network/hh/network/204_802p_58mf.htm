<P>NDIS includes definitions so that legacy miniport drivers continue to compile. These legacy drivers support only packet priority and not the full 802.1Q packet information, which includes VLAN identifiers. NDIS defines: 

<UL>
	<LI>The <B>Ieee8021pPriority</B> constant as equivalent to the <B>Ieee8021QInfo</B> value of the NDIS_PER_PACKET_INFO enumeration. 
<PRE>#define Ieee8021pPriority   Ieee8021QInfo</PRE>
</LI>

	<LI>The IEEE8021PPRIORITY data type as a UINT.
<PRE>typedef UINT                IEEE8021PPRIORITY;</PRE>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>The Windows DDK can still correctly build a legacy miniport driver that accesses per-packet priority information as described in the following examples:

<UL>
	<LI>To insert a priority value into a packet descriptor, a legacy miniport driver calls the <A HREF="103ndisx_0bjm.htm">NDIS_PER_PACKET_INFO_FROM_PACKET</A> macro. In this call, the miniport driver passes a pointer to NDIS_PACKET that describes the packet, and <B>Ieee8021pPriority</B> that indicates that NDIS should insert the priority value in the packet. For example, in the following operation, the <I>pPacketDesc</I> variable points to a packet, and the <I>UserPriority</I> variable holds the priority value to insert into that packet. To insert the priority value into the packet, a miniport driver performs the following operation:
<PRE>UINT UserPriority;
NDIS_PER_PACKET_INFO_FROM_PACKET(pPacketDesc, Ieee8021pPriority) = 
                                   (PVOID)(ULONG_PTR)UserPriority;</PRE>
</LI>

	<LI>To retrieve the priority value from a packet descriptor, a legacy miniport driver calls the NDIS_PER_PACKET_INFO_FROM_PACKET macro. In this call, the miniport driver passes a pointer to NDIS_PACKET that describes the packet. In this call, the miniport driver also passes <B>Ieee8021pPriority</B> that indicates that NDIS should retrieve the priority value from the packet. For example, to retrieve the priority value that is contained in the packet pointed to by the <I>pPacketDesc</I> variable, and then to assign this priority value to the <I>UserPriority</I> variable, a miniport driver performs the following operation:
<PRE>UserPriority = 
   (IEEE8021PPRIORITY)NDIS_PER_PACKET_INFO_FROM_PACKET(pPacketDesc,
                                                Ieee8021pPriority);</PRE>
