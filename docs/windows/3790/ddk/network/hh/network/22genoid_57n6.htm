<P>The OID_GEN_PHYSICAL_MEDIUM OID specifies the types of physical media that the NIC supports. This OID is essentially an extension of <A HREF="22genoid_6whe.htm">OID_GEN_MEDIA_SUPPORTED</A>. NICs use this OID to differentiate their physical media from media that they declared to support in the OID_GEN_MEDIA_SUPPORTED query. These media types are listed as a proper subset of the following system-defined values from the NDIS_PHYSICAL_MEDIUM enumeration:

<DL>
<DT><B>NdisPhysicalMediumWirelessLan</B></DT>

<DD>Packets are transferred over a wireless LAN network.<BR>
Includes, for example, IEEE 802.11.</DD>

<DT><B>NdisPhysicalMediumCableModem</B></DT>

<DD>Packets are transferred over a DOCSIS-based cable network.</DD>

<DT><B>NdisPhysicalMediumPhoneLine</B></DT>

<DD>Packets are transferred over standard phone lines.<BR>
Includes, for example, HomePNA media.</DD>

<DT><B>NdisPhysicalMediumPowerLine</B></DT>

<DD>Packets are transferred over wiring that is connected to a power distribution system. </DD>

<DT><B>NdisPhysicalMediumDSL</B></DT>

<DD>Packets are transferred over a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) network.<BR>
Includes, for example, ADSL and UADSL (G.Lite).</DD>

<DT><B>NdisPhysicalMediumFibreChannel</B></DT>

<DD>Packets are transferred over a Fibre Channel interconnect.</DD>

<DT><B>NdisPhysicalMedium1394</B></DT>

<DD>Packets are transferred over an IEEE 1394 bus.</DD>

<DT><B>NdisPhysicalMediumWirelessWan</B></DT>

<DD>Packets are transferred over a Wireless WAN link. Includes, for example, CDPD, CDMA and GPRS.</DD>

<DT><B>NdisPhysicalMediumUnspecified</B></DT>

<DD>The physical medium is none of the above.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>This OID should be implemented in miniport drivers for NICs that support newer networks even though those networks transfer packets that appear to the operating system and to NDIS as standard and well known media types. These newer networks are listed preceding. </P>

<P>It is easier to create miniport drivers using standard media types. Therefore, miniport drivers for NICs that support newer networks should still be written to use standard media types, which are enumerated in OID_GEN_MEDIA_SUPPORTED. For example, miniport drivers that transfer packets that appear like Ethernet and ATM media should declare their support of those media. Miniport drivers declare support of Ethernet and ATM media by specifying media types NdisMedium802_3 and NdisMediumAtm respectively in an OID_GEN_MEDIA_SUPPORTED query. In order for a miniport driver to declare support of standard media types, that miniport driver's MAC layer should conform to characteristics for those standard media types. </P>

<P>Newer networks transfer packets that might appear like standard media but that might have new features or slight differences from the standard. This OID was developed so upper-layer drivers and applications could determine the actual networks to which a NIC connects. After retrieving information about underlying networks, upper-layer drivers and applications could use this information to modify how such drivers and applications behave. </P>
