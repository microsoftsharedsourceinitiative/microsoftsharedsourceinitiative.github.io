<P>Underlying connectionless miniport drivers can indicate packets in two ways:

<UL>
	<LI>A miniport driver calls the nonmedia-specific <A HREF="103ndisx_5uuq.htm"><B>NdisMIndicateReceivePacket</B></A>, passing a pointer to an array of pointers to one or more packet descriptors, relinquishing ownership of the indicated packet resources to higher level drivers. When the higher level drivers have consumed the data, they return the packet descriptors (and the resources they specify) to the NIC driver. </LI>

	<LI>A miniport driver calls a media-specific <B>NdisM</B><I>Xxx</I><B>IndicateReceive</B> function, passing a pointer to a lookahead buffer and the total size of the packet. </LI>
</UL>

<P>An intermediate driver with a connectionless lower edge must have <A HREF="104tdlow_62k2.htm"><I>ProtocolReceive</I></A> and <A HREF="104tdlow_5i7n.htm"><I>ProtocolReceivePacket</I></A> functions. </P>

<P>Because<B> </B>the underlying miniport driver also indicates per-packet information and/or OOB data, the intermediate driver must retrieve this information in <I>ProtocolReceive</I> by calling <A HREF="103ndisx_4faq.htm"><B>NdisGetReceivedPacket</B></A> and <A HREF="103ndisx_7xma.htm">NDIS_GET_ORIGINAL_PACKET</A>.</P>
