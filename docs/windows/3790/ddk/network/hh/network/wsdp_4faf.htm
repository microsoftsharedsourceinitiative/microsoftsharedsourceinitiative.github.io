<P>The proxy driver must secure ownership of the virtual addresses of user-mode buffers whenever the SAN service provider for the proxy driver caches those buffers. For more information on caching buffers, see <A HREF="wsdp_25ev.htm">Caching Registered Memory</A>. The proxy driver secures ownership of a user-mode buffer, so that the operating system notifies the Windows Sockets switch if the buffer is released back to the operating system by an application. To secure ownership of a buffer, the proxy driver must call the <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()"><B>MmSecureVirtualMemory</B></A> function. In this call, the proxy driver passes a pointer to the starting address of the buffer and the size, in bytes, of the buffer. </P>

<P>If the virtual-to-physical mappings for the cached buffer are scheduled to change, the switch is notified and calls the SAN service provider's <A HREF="wsdpref_1v5e.htm"><B>WSPMemoryRegistrationCacheCallback</B></A> function to remove the buffer registration from the SAN NIC and the buffer from the SAN service provider's cache. The SAN service provider's proxy driver, in turn, must call the <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_2.Click()"><B>MmUnsecureVirtualMemory</B></A> function to release ownership of the buffer. In this call, the proxy driver passes the handle to the buffer that was previously returned from the <B>MmSecureVirtualMemory</B> call. </P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A driver that tries to access a user-mode buffer that was secured through a call to <B>MmSecureVirtualMemory</B> can potentially bring down the operating system. Therefore, when the proxy driver accesses such a user-mode buffer, it must also use the <B>try/except</B> mechanism around the code that accesses the buffer. For more information on <B>try/except</B>, see the Visual C++® documentation.</P>

<P>A SAN service provider can send I/O control (IOCTL) requests to the proxy driver to secure and release ownership of a buffer. For more information, see <A HREF="wsdp_4q1z.htm">Implementing IOCTLs for a SAN Service Provider</A>. </P>
