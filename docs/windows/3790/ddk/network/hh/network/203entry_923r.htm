<P>After a miniport driver has determined its hardware resources and called <B>NdisMSetAttributesEx</B>, it claims the system resources it will use. The miniport driver must call <B>NdisMSetAttributesEx</B> before claiming resources, including initializing timers.</P>

<P>Regardless of the type of NIC it manages, a miniport driver must allocate the memory it needs to manage its device. This memory is in addition to that allocated by the miniport driver for its miniport driver adapter context. For instance, the miniport driver might allocate memory for receiving incoming frames or for staging buffers for outgoing data.</P>

<P>The following sections describe how miniport drivers allocate memory and register I/O ports. These operations are described in general terms and then specifically for bus-master DMA NICs, programmed I/O NICs, memory-mapped NICs, and slave DMA NICs.</P>
