<P>After closing any associated connections, a TDI client is ready to close an open transport address. </P>

<P>When a client no longer has any use for an open transport address or control channel, it <I>must</I> release that object as follows: 

<UL>
	<LI>Pass the file object pointer returned by <B>ObReferenceObjectByHandle</B> to <B>ObDereferenceObject</B>.</LI>

	<LI>Pass the file handle that was returned by <B>ZwCreateFile</B> when the connection endpoint was opened to <B>ZwClose</B>. </LI>
</UL>

<P>In a similar manner, a TDI client also can close any control channel it has opened in its underlying transport driver. </P>

<P>If the client opened the file object representing a control channel with a call to <B>IoGetDeviceObjectPointer</B>, it must pass the returned file object pointer to <B>ObDereferenceObject</B> to release the file object. </P>

<P>Then, the I/O Manager submits IRPs to the transport’s <A HREF="31tddisp_3vn6.htm">TdiDispatchCleanup</A> and <A HREF="31tddisp_7t9u.htm">TdiDispatchClose</A> routines.</P>

<P>These transport routines immediately close the transport address or control channel and free all associated client-specific transport driver resources. For example, TdiDispatchCleanup cancels any pending requests on a transport address that is being closed, deregisters any ClientEvent<I>Xxx</I> handlers on that address, and cleans up client-specific state for that address. If this client has released the last file handle for a particular transport address, the transport also releases internal state for that transport address. </P>

<P>After <B>ZwClose</B> returns to the client, it cannot submit a request to the underlying transport for the transport address or control channel it previously had open. The client-specific file object representing that address or control channel no longer exists. </P>

<P></P>
