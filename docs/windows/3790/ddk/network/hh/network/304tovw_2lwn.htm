<P>When TDI is loaded, the configuration registry has entries for each TDI transport driver and kernel-mode client operating on a particular network. Using binding information in the registry, the operating system loads network drivers.</P>

<P>Then, the I/O Manager creates driver objects and calls the <B>DriverEntry</B> routine of each TDI transport driver. The I/O Manager calls each transport driver’s <B>DriverEntry</B> routine until all TDI drivers are loaded and registered on the network. </P>

<P>A TDI transport driver or a lower protocol component in its transport stack must register with the NDIS library by calling <A HREF="103ndisx_2cfm.htm"><B>NdisRegisterProtocol</B></A> if it will bind itself to an underlying NDIS NIC driver. As NDIS is called by the PnP Manager to initialize each NIC found in the machine, NDIS calls the registered <I>ProtocolBindAdapter</I> functions at the lower edge of the appropriate TDI transport drivers or transport stacks to give each transport the opportunity to bind itself to the appropriate NDIS miniport drivers. </P>

<P>When a TDI transport driver is bound to an NDIS miniport driver or has layered itself above an NDIS protocol driver that has bound itself to such a miniport driver, the TDI driver should be ready to respond to any registered TDI client that submits a request to open any network address that the TDI transport has already registered with TDI on that binding. </P>

<P>Consequently, a PnP-aware TDI transport must not call <A HREF="33tdifun_9r02.htm"><B>TdiProviderReady</B></A> until it has set up its per-device-object and per-address state for each initialization-time call that it makes to <A HREF="33tdifun_2d0y.htm"><B>TdiRegisterDeviceObject</B></A> and <A HREF="33tdifun_6uia.htm"><B>TdiRegisterNetAddress</B></A>. </P>

<P>Note that such a TDI transport calls <A HREF="33tdifun_99te.htm"><B>TdiRegisterProvider</B></A> and <B>TdiProviderReady</B> only once each during system startup. However, the transport can make many run-time calls to the TDI-provided PnP for Windows&nbsp;2000 and later and power-management functions. For example, <B>TdiRegister/DeregisterDeviceObject</B>, <B>TdiRegister/DeregisterNetAddress</B>, and <B>TdiPnPPowerRequest</B>. </P>

<P>For more information about PnP and power-management support for Windows&nbsp;2000 and later, see <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">Plug and Play</A> and <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_2.Click()">Power Management</A>. For particulars on how the NDIS library indicates PnP and power events, see <A HREF="302pro_8o6f.htm">Handling PnP Events and PM Events in a Protocol Driver</A>. </P>
