<H4>Parameters</H4>

<DL>
<DT><I>NdisBindingHandle</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the handle that was returned by <A HREF="103ndisx_9koi.htm"><B>NdisOpenAdapter</B></A> that identifies the target NIC or the virtual adapter of the underlying driver to which the calling driver is bound. </DD>

<DT><I>MacContext</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies a context handle that the underlying driver associates with the packet received from the network. This handle was passed as an input parameter to the calling driver's <A HREF="104tdlow_62k2.htm"><I>ProtocolReceive</I></A> function. This handle is opaque to the calling driver and reserved for use by the underlying driver that made the indication. 
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Return Values</H4>

<P>Returns a pointer to a packet descriptor that contains data that was received on the underlying driver. </P>

<H4>Headers</H4>

<P>Declared in <I>Ndis.h</I>. Include <I>Ndis.h</I>.</P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>Several protocol or intermediate drivers can be bound to a single underlying NIC, and each such driver can receive an indication for the same packet. Such a packet is read-only to these drivers. Each such driver's <I>ProtocolReceive</I> function determines whether to call <B>NdisGetReceivedPacket</B> to retrieve the indicated packet. </P>

<P>Callers of <B>NdisGetReceivedPacket</B> run at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. </P>
