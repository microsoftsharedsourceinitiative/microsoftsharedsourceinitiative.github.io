<P>A protocol driver calls <A HREF="103ndisx_0u42.htm"><B>NdisRequest</B></A> or <A HREF="103ndisx_8xde.htm"><B>NdisCoRequest</B></A> to query the underlying NDIS driver for its characteristics and to set the driver's operating characteristics. The protocol driver can also negotiate certain parameters for the binding. A protocol driver calls <B>Ndis(Co)Request</B> after it has successfully bound to one or more adapters. </P>

<P><A HREF="21oidovw_8q9e.htm">NDIS Object Identifiers</A> (OIDs) identify adapter parameters which include device characteristics, configurable settings, and statistics. The driver can make requests with general OID_GEN_(CO_)<I>XXX</I> types of OIDs, which are independent of the underlying medium. The driver can also make requests with medium-specific OIDs that are defined for a particular medium type. The <A HREF="netref_886q.htm"><I>Network Reference</I></A> documents both types of OIDs. Some OIDs are mandatory, meaning an underlying driver must support them; others are optional. </P>
