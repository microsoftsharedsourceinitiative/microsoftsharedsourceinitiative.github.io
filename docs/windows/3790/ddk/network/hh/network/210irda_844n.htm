<P>The IrDA protocol driver calls the <A HREF="103ndisx_88s2.htm"><B>NdisSendPackets</B></A> function to send an array of packet descriptors (<A HREF="105nstru_6jn6.htm">NDIS_PACKET</A> structures) to an underlying IrDA miniport driver. These packet descriptors only specify the frame from the address element to the end of the information element. The IrDA miniport driver must add all other frame elements before it transmits the frame. Likewise, the IrDA miniport driver must strip from a received packet all elements other than those from the address element to the end of the information element, before the IrDA miniport driver indicates the packet to the IrDA protocol driver. </P>

<P>The IrDA miniport driver must perform any coding that is required to transform a packet that is transmitted to the infrared media. Likewise, the IrDA miniport driver must perform any decoding that is required to transform a packet, that is received from the infrared media, back into its original form. </P>

<P>If a packet that is received from the infrared media is invalid, the IrDA miniport driver must not indicate the packet to the IrDA protocol driver. A packet might be invalid for the following reasons: 

<UL>
	<LI>The packet is incomplete. </LI>

	<LI>The packet's cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is invalid. </LI>

	<LI>The packet contains a reject sequence. </LI>
</UL>
