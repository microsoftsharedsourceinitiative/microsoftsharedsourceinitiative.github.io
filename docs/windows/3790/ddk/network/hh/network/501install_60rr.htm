<P>If a component has an associated service (device driver), the <I>add-registry-section</I> referenced by the <I>DDInstall</I> section for that component must add a <B>Service</B> value to the Ndi key. The <B>Service</B> value is a REG_SZ value that specifies the primary service associated with the component. The <B>Service</B> value must match the <I>ServiceName</I> parameter of the <B>AddService</B> directive that references the <I>service-install-section</I> for the primary service. For more information, see <A HREF="501install_7nxj.htm">DDInstall Services Section</A>.</P>

<P>If a component has one or more associated services, the <I>add-registry-section</I> referenced by the <I>DDInstall</I> section for that component must add a <B>CoServices</B> value to the <B>Ndi</B> key. The <B>CoServices</B> value is a MULTI_SZ value that specifies all the services that the component installs, including the primary service specified by the <B>Service</B> value. The <B>CoServices</B> value is required for all <B>NetTrans</B>, <B>NetClient</B>, and <B>NetService</B> components. </P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Net</B> components (adapters) should not have a <B>CoServices</B> value, because only one service can be associated with an adapter.</P>

<P>Except for shutting down services, all service-related actions are performed on the <B>CoServices</B> in the order that they are listed. For example, services are started in the order that they are listed. Services are stopped, however, in reverse order. Service-related actions for a component are performed on a service only if that service is listed in <B>CoServices</B>.</P>

<P>If one or more of the services that are listed in <B>CoServices</B> should not be started during the installation of the operating system, that service or services should be listed in an <B>ExcludeSetupStartServices</B> value (MULTI_SZ) added to the <B>Ndi</B> key by the <I>add-registry-section</I> for the component.</P>

<P>The following is an <I>add-registry-section</I> that adds service-related values to the <B>Ndi</B> key:</P>
