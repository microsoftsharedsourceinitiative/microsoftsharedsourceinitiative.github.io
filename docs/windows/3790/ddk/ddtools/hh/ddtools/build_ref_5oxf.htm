<P>The COFFBASE_TXT_FILE macro specifies the name of the file that contains the base addresses for the images you build.</P>

<P>By default, this is <I>%DDKROOT%\bin\coffbase.txt</I>. You can specify a different file by setting the COFFBASE_TXT_FILE macro equal to the full path and file name of the alternate file.</P>

<P>It is recommended that you set COFFBASE_TXT_FILE to a value other than the default. If you edit the <I>coffbase.txt</I> file in its default location and then reinstall the Windows DDK, the file will be overwritten.</P>

<P>The linker will open this file and search for the name of the executable you are building. See <A HREF="build_ref_6kqb.htm">COFFBASE</A> for details of what name is used in this lookup.</P>

<P>The file should have three columns. The first is the name of the executable. The second is the base address of the image; this is the starting address of where the executable image will reside in memory. The last is the maximum size of the image. Numbers can be prefixed with <B>0x</B> (hexadecimal) or not prefixed at all (decimal).</P>

<P>There should also be an entry with the name "usermode" that is the default value.</P>

<P>Here is an example:</P>

<PRE>usermode      0x60000000    0x20000000
MyDll         0x70000000    0x00010000
AnotherDll2   0x70010000    0x00010000
</PRE>

<P>In this example, if you have set COFFBASE to MyDll, the linker will use a starting address of 0x70000000 and a maximum size of 0x00010000.</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any specified base address or size is just an educated guess. Different architectures and build environments are going to generate different size binaries — thus, for example, the <I>coffbase.txt</I> file you use in an x86 free build environment may be inappropriate for an Itanium checked build environment. It is probably best to make your best guess when writing your <I>coffbase.txt</I> file, and then running the <I>rebase.exe</I> tool after the build is complete to pack all your binaries together in an optimal manner.</P>
