<P>The Windows XP and later version of Driver Verifier Manager begins with a screen which allows you to select one of five tasks. Whichever task you choose, you will be shown a series of screens that can be navigated by using the <B>Back</B> and <B>Next</B> buttons.</P>

<P>When this sequence is complete, use the <B>Finish</B> button to save any changes you have made and exit Driver Verifier Manager. If you wish to discard your changes, use the <B>Cancel</B> button.</P>

<P>The following tasks can be chosen from the first screen of Driver Verifier Manager:

<DL>
<DT><B>Create standard settings</B></DT>

<DD>This will select a standard set of Driver Verifier options, and then allow you to choose which drivers will be verified. These settings will take effect after the next boot. See <A HREF="dv_5q43.htm">Selecting Driver Verifier Options</A> and <A HREF="dv_00z7.htm">Selecting Drivers to be Verified</A> for details.</DD>

<DT><B>Create custom settings</B></DT>

<DD>This allows you to activate any of Driver Verifier's actions and choose which drivers will be verified. These settings will take effect after the next boot. See <A HREF="dv_5q43.htm">Selecting Driver Verifier Options</A> and <A HREF="dv_00z7.htm">Selecting Drivers to be Verified</A> for details.</DD>

<DT><B>Delete existing settings</B></DT>

<DD>This will cause all of Driver Verifier's options to be deactivated and delete the list of drivers being verified. This takes effect after the next boot.</DD>

<DT><B>Display existing settings</B></DT>

<DD>This will display the nonvolatile Driver Verifier settings — the options selected and the drivers selected for verification. These are the settings that will be active after the next boot. See <A HREF="dv_5m9f.htm">Viewing Driver Verifier Settings</A> for details.</DD>

<DT><B>Display information about the currently-verified drivers</B></DT>

<DD>This will display statistics related to Driver Verifier's actions. See <A HREF="dv_9ib7.htm">Monitoring Global Counters</A> and <A HREF="dv_26pf.htm">Monitoring Individual Counters</A> for details. It will also allow you to view and alter Driver Verifier's volatile actions. See <A HREF="dv_0a9f.htm">Using Volatile Settings</A>.
