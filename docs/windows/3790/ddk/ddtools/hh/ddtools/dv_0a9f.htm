<P>Most changes to Driver Verifier's status (activating, deactivating, changing options, or changing the list of drivers being verified) take effect on reboot.</P>

<P>However, some options can be activated and deactivated without a reboot intervening. These are referred to as <I>volatile settings</I>. These settings take place immediately, and will last until the next boot, or until they are changed again.</P>

<P>Only the Special Memory Pool, Forcing IRQL Checking, and Low Resources Simulation options can be activated or deactivated in a volatile manner.</P>

<P>In Windows XP and later, the list of drivers being verified can also be changed in a volatile manner. However, a driver can only be added or removed from the volatile settings if it is not currently loaded.</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;For volatile settings to be enabled, at least <I>one</I> Driver Verifier option must have been selected during the last boot, and at least <I>one</I> driver must have been selected to be verified. If Driver Verifier was completely inactive during the last boot, it cannot be activated through volatile settings alone.</P>

<P>Volatile settings can be set by using the <A HREF="dv_5xir.htm">Verifier Command Line</A>, or by using the Driver Verifier Manager graphical interface. There are two versions of Driver Verifier Manager — one for <A HREF="dv_2dtf.htm">Windows&nbsp;2000</A> and one for <A HREF="dv_5w1f.htm">Windows&nbsp;XP and later</A>.</P>

<H4>Verifier Command Line</H4>

<P>To add or delete volatile options, use the <B>/volatile /flags</B> parameter.</P>

<P><I>(Windows XP and later)</I>  To add or remove a driver from the volatile list, use the <B>/volatile /adddriver</B> or <B>/volatile /removedriver</B> parameters.</P>

<P>See <A HREF="dv_5xir.htm">Verifier Command Line</A> for details.</P>

<H4>Driver Verifier Manager <I>(Windows&nbsp;2000)</I></H4>

<P>To view the Driver Verifier features that are currently active, select either the <B>Driver Status</B> or the <B>Volatile Settings</B> tab.</P>

<P>To change the volatile settings, select the <B>Volatile Settings</B> tab.</P>

<P>The display on each of these screens shows the Driver Verifier options currently in effect, including volatile settings, but not including changes to permanent settings that are scheduled to take effect after the next boot. Each driver will have its status listed.</P>

<P>If you wish to make changes, select or unselect the desired options, then press <B>Apply</B>.</P>

<H4>Driver Verifier Manager <I>(Windows&nbsp;XP and later)</I></H4>

<P>To view the Driver Verifier features that are currently active, or to change the volatile settings, start Driver Verifier Manager and select the <B>Display information about the currently verified drivers</B> task. Then press <B>Next</B>.</P>

<P>The display on this screen shows the Driver Verifier options currently in effect, including volatile settings, but not including changes to permanent settings that are scheduled to take effect after the next boot. Each driver will have its status listed.</P>

<P>To change the active options, press <B>Change</B>. Select or deselect the desired options, and then press <B>OK</B>.</P>

<P>To verify a new driver, press <B>Add</B>. This opens a popup window that allows you to browse the system for the desired driver file. After locating the correct driver, press <B>Open</B> to add it to the list of verified drivers.</P>

<P>To remove a driver from the list, select that driver's name and press <B>Remove</B>.</P>

<P>Then press <B>Next</B>, <B>Next</B> again, and <B>Finish</B>.</P>

<H4>Driver Status Values</H4>

<P>There are three possible status values for drivers shown on this screen. They are as follows:

<DL>
<DT><B>Loaded</B></DT>

<DD>The driver is currently loaded and is being verified.</DD>

<DT><B>Unloaded</B></DT>

<DD>The driver was loaded and verified at least once since the last boot, but is currently not loaded.</DD>

<DT><B>Never Loaded</B></DT>

<DD>Driver Verifier was instructed to verify this driver, but the driver has not been loaded since this request. This can indicate that the driver is loaded on demand and has not yet been required in this session. It might also indicate that a nonexistent driver was requested for verification, or that a driver image file has been corrupted.
