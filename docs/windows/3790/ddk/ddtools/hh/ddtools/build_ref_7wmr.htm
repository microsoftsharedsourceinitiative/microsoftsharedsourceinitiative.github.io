<P>Use the VERIFIER_DDK_EXTENSIONS environment variable to activate the Call Usage Verifier (CUV) tool.</P>

<P>When this variable is defined and set equal to a nonzero value, your driver will be built with CUV checking. This is only available in the build environments for Windows&nbsp;XP and later versions of Windows.</P>

<P>This variable may be set by default in some checked build environment windows. Use the <B>set</B> command to determine if this variable is set in the window you are using.  </P>

<P>For details, see <A HREF="cuv_2wab.htm">Call Usage Verifier</A>.</P>

<P class=note><B>Caution</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The version of your driver that you release to your customers must not be built with CUV. Drivers that are built with CUV include <I>ddk_ext.lib</I>, which makes them larger and slower. Generally, you should only activate CUV when building drivers in the checked build environment.</P>
