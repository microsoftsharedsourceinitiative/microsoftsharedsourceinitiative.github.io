<P>The typical setup for debugging kernel-mode drivers on an NT-based operating system consists of two systems that are connected by a null modem cable (or optionally, for Windows XP and later, by a 1394 connection). For details, see <A HREF="dbgblurb_1eyb.htm">Hardware Requirements for Debugging</A>.</P>

<P>The <I>host computer</I> is the system on which the debugger runs. It should be a stable system and should always run the free build of the operating system. </P>

<P>The <I>target computer</I> is the system on which the driver you are testing runs. It can run either the free build or the checked build. For more accurate debugging, the checked build is preferred.</P>

<P>The debugger running on the host computer controls the target computer through the attached null modem cable or 1394 debugging cable.</P>
