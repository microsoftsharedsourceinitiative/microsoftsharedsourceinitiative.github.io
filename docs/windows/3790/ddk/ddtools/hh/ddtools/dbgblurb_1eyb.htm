<P>User-mode drivers can be debugged with a single computer and either the free or checked build of the operating system. Debugging a kernel-mode driver, however, requires two machines, a <I>target computer</I> and a <I>host computer</I>. The target computer runs the driver or another kernel-mode application. The host computer runs the debugger.</P>

<H4>Hardware Requirements for Debugging an NT-Based Operating System</H4>

<P>The NT-based operating systems are available in two versions: the <I>free build</I> and the <I>checked build</I>. The checked build has many additional features that make it very useful to run on a computer being debugged. For full details, see <A HREF="checked_6dir.htm">Using the Checked Build of Windows</A>.</P>

<P>Kernel debugging does not require specific combinations of the free or checked builds. You can debug a free build product from a free or checked system or debug a checked build product from a free or checked system. However, it is often better to debug a driver on a checked build to look for bugs, and to test it on a free build to check its performance.</P>

<P>The following figure shows the typical setup for debugging a kernel-mode driver. Windows&nbsp;2000 will only support a null modem connection, but Windows&nbsp;XP and later will also support a 1394 connection.</P>

<P><B>Typical NT-Based Debugging Setup</B></P>

<P>For full details on hardware and software requirements for debugging, consult the documentation in the Debugging Tools for Windows package. See <A HREF="dbgblurb_25bn.htm">Debugging Tools for NT-Based Operating Systems</A> for details.</P>

<H4>Testing on Multiple Target Computers</H4>

<P>All drivers that will run on the NT-based operating system should be debugged and tested on both single-processor and multiprocessor computers. In addition, it's a good idea to test on the various operating system product suites, such as Personal, Professional, Server, and Advanced Server.</P>
