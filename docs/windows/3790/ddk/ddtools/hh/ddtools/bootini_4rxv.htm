<P>Like the boot options on x86-based systems, the boot options in NVRAM on Itanium-based systems are of two types:

<UL>
	<LI><I>Globally-defined variables</I> that determine which systems boot and in what order, such as <I>BootOrder</I>, an ordered array of NVRAM boot entry IDs, and <I>Timeout</I>, the boot menu timeout. 
<P>These variables apply to all bootable devices and bootable programs on the computer, including all operating system configurations.
</LI>

	<LI><I>Boot option variables</I> that apply only to a particular load configuration of a bootable device or program, such as an operating system.
<P>These system-specific variables comprise a <I>boot entry</I> for each configuration of a bootable device or bootable program on the computer.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>Unlike the <I>boot.ini</I> file, NVRAM storage is finite, and it is used to store other vital system variables, including options that that determine the boot order of devices, and EFI driver entries, which are settings that direct EFI to load particular EFI driver extensions for devices. As a result, you need to manage the NVRAM resource and delete unused boot options periodically.</P>
