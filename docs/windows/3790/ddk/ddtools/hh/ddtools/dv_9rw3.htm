<P>The following sections describe the different powers of Driver Verifier:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="dv_8o6r.htm"><B>Automatic Checks</B></A> 
<P>These checks are always performed on a driver that is being verified, regardless of which options have been selected. If the driver uses memory at an improper IRQL, improperly calls or releases spin locks and memory allocations, improperly switches stacks, or frees memory pool without first removing timers, Driver Verifier will detect this behavior. When the driver is unloaded, Driver Verifier will check to see that it has properly released its resources.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="dv_3i7n.htm"><B>Special Memory Pool</B></A> 
<P>When this option is active, Driver Verifier allocates most of the driver's memory requests from a special pool. This special pool is monitored for memory overruns, memory underruns, and memory that is accessed after it is freed.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="dv_03ub.htm"><B>Forcing IRQL Checking</B></A> 
<P>When this option is active, Driver Verifier places extreme memory pressure on the driver by invalidating pageable code. If the driver attempts to access paged memory at the wrong IRQL or while holding a spin lock, Driver Verifier detects this behavior.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="dv_5j03.htm"><B>Low Resources Simulation</B></A> 
<P>When this option is active, Driver Verifier randomly fails pool allocation requests and other resource requests. By injecting these allocation faults into the system, Driver Verifier tests the driver's ability to cope with a low-resource situation.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="dv_2ayb.htm"><B>Memory Pool Tracking</B></A> 
<P>When this option is active, Driver Verifier checks to see if the driver has freed all its memory allocations when it is unloaded. This reveals memory leaks.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="dv_962b.htm"><B>I/O Verification</B></A> 
<P>When this option is active, Driver Verifier allocates the driver's IRPs from a special pool, and monitors the driver's I/O handling. This detects illegal or inconsistent use of I/O routines.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="dv_4i9f.htm"><B>DMA Verification</B></A> 
<P><I>( Windows XP and later)</I>  When this option is active, Driver Verifier monitors the driver's use of DMA routines. This detects improper use of DMA buffers, adapters, and map registers.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="dv_8pkj.htm"><B>Deadlock Detection</B></A> 
<P><I>(Windows XP and later)</I>  When this option is active, Driver Verifier monitors the driver's use of spin locks, mutexes, and fast mutexes. This detects if the driver's code has the potential for causing a deadlock at some point.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="dv_6d0z.htm"><B>SCSI Verification</B></A> 
<P><I>(Windows XP and later)</I>  When this option is active, Driver Verifier monitors a SCSI miniport driver for improper use of exported SCSI port routines, excessive delays, and improper handling of SCSI requests.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="dv_9s37.htm"><B>Disk Integrity Verification</B></A> 
<P><I>(Windows Server&nbsp;2003 and later)</I>  When this option is active, Driver Verifier monitors hard disk access, and detects whether the disk is preserving its data correctly.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="dv_8p9v.htm"><B>IRP Logging</B></A> 
<P><I>(Windows Server&nbsp;2003 and later)</I>  When this option is active, Driver Verifier monitors a driver's use of IRPs and creates a log of IRP use.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="dv_5o4z.htm"><B>Driver Verifier Options for Graphics Drivers</B></A> describes the actions of Driver Verifier on kernel-mode graphics drivers that use the Graphics Driver Interface (GDI).</LI>
