<P>The NTKEEPRESOURCETMPFILES macro delays the conversion of Resouce Compiler (RC) binaries.</P>

<P>The RC generates a binary file, but this file cannot be linked into a final image because it is not in the right format. Generally, the Build utility converts it to the right format as soon as the RC creates it (unlike other build programs, which usually convert the file during the linking process).</P>

<P>Converting the file immediately has the advantage that if you build a file once, it can be linked as many times as you want and it will never need to be reconverted. But it has the disadvantage that tools that understand the RC output cannot be used.</P>

<P>If you want the RC output format to be preserved, set:</P>

<PRE>NTKEEPRESOURCETMPFILES=1
</PRE>

<P>This delays the conversion until the linking is done. Every time you link the file, the Build utility will convert it. This makes your links a little slower, but means you can use other tools, such as the Visual C++® Resource Editor, to modify it before you link it.</P>
