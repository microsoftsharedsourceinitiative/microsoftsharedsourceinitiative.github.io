<P>On Intel Itanium-based systems, boot options are stored on the processor in nonvolatile random access memory, known as NVRAM. NVRAM is storage that can be edited, but is retained even when you turn off power to the computer.</P>

<P>The startup functions that are implemented in the BIOS and the boot manager on x86-based systems are handled by Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) components on Itanium-based systems, namely the EFI BIOS and EFI Boot Manager. </P>

<P>When the computer starts, the EFI Boot Manager reads the boot options and displays the entries for bootable devices and bootable programs, such as operating systems, in the boot menu. Then it loads the selected device or program in accordance with the boot options.</P>

<P>To configure features related to driver debugging and testing, you must edit the boot options in NVRAM. To do this, you create new boot entries and then change the options and parameters in those boot entries..</P>
