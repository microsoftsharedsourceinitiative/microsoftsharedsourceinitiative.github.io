<P>Driver Verifier is a tool that can monitor kernel-mode drivers and graphics drivers to verify that they are not making illegal function calls or causing system corruption. It can perform a large number of checks on these drivers, as well as subject them to a variety of stresses and tests to flush out improper behavior.</P>

<P>The following sections explain the workings of Driver Verifier:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="dv_9rw3.htm">Driver Verifier Options</A> describes each of the actions of Driver Verifier in detail.</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="dv_1gpz.htm">Using Driver Verifier</A> explains how to activate Driver Verifier, how to choose which options are active and which drivers will be verified, and how to monitor the behavior of drivers being verified.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Driver Verifier can be used on any number of drivers simultaneously, or on one driver at a time. It can perform a variety of actions, and most of these can be optionally enabled or disabled. This allows you to put a driver through heavy stresses or through a more streamlined test.</P>

<P>Driver Verifier can verify any number of drivers. However, the Special Memory Pool and I/O Verification options will be more effective when used on one driver at a time.  </P>

<P>Driver Verifier works on both the free and checked builds of Microsoft® Windows®. It is available in Windows&nbsp;2000 and later, but not in Windows 98/Me.</P>
