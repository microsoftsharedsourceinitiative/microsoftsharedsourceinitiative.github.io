<P>The NOT_LEAN_AND_MEAN macro causes the Build utility to use a much greater number of header files.</P>

<P>Generally, Visual Studio® compilations use the <I>windows.h</I> file. This file tests to see whether a variable named WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN is defined. When WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN is defined, a large number of header files are deliberately excluded by <I>windows.h</I>; only the actual Windows headers are used. The equivalent Build utility procedure is to leave the NOT_LEAN_AND_MEAN macro <I>undefined</I> (or equal to zero). This is the <I>default</I> setting of the Build utility.</P>

<P>If the WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN variable is <I>undefined</I> in a Visual Studio build, or if NOT_LEAN_AND_MEAN=1 in a Build utility build, all header files are used. This is a much larger comilation — in addition to the Windows headers, it includes the OLE, RPC, and network headers. This is the <I>default</I> setting for Visual Studio.</P>

<P>If you want to emulate the default Visual Studio behavior, define the following in your <I>sources</I> file:</P>

<PRE>NOT_LEAN_AND_MEAN=1
</PRE>

<P>The best practice is to review your code and remove unnecessary header files. However, this is sometimes a much more difficult process.</P>
