<P>Unfortunately, boot entry backup files are not always usable. </P>

<P>On Itanium-based systems, the EFI components identify disk partitions by a partition GUID. The GUID for the EFI partition and the GUID for the operating system partition are exported to the boot entry backup file along with other data for the entry.</P>

<P>As a result, you cannot import boot entries from backup files created on other disks or other computers. Also, if the system volume numbers change, if you convert from basic to dynamic disks, or if you format the drive, the GUIDs that identify the disk partitions in the backup files will no longer match the actual partition GUIDs.</P>

<P>When you import an entry from a boot entry backup file with invalid partition GUIDs, EFI Boot Manager cannot associate the partition GUIDs in the file with actual disk partitions, and therefore it cannot resolve the path to the boot loader file or the path to the operating system directory.</P>

<P>The following Bootcfg sample shows a boot entry that was imported with invalid partition GUIDs.</P>

<PRE>Boot entry ID:    4
OS Friendly Name: Windows Server 2003 - debug
OsLoadOptions:    /debug /debugport=com1 /baudrate=115200
BootFilePath:     (null)
OsFilePath:       (null)
</PRE>

<P>In this case, you must recreate the boot entry by copying another boot entry for the operating system installation and then changing the parameters. </P>
