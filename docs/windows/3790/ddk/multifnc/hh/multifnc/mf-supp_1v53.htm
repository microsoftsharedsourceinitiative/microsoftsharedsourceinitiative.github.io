<P>The PC Card multifunction standard specifies that a multifunction device has a set of configuration registers in attribute memory for each function. These registers allow the PCMCIA bus driver to, for example, enable each function independently and define a range of I/O resources that are exclusive to each function. The standard also specifies that a multifunction device contains, in attribute memory, the address of each set of configuration registers. These addresses enable the PCMCIA bus driver to program the configuration registers.</P>

<P>If a 16-bit PC Card device implements the PC Card multifunction standard completely and correctly, the vendor of such a device has minimal INF and driver requirements to ensure that the device is configured properly on an NT-based system. See <A HREF="mf-supp_3skn.htm">Supporting PC Cards that Conform to the Multifunction Standard</A> for more information.</P>

<P>If a 16-bit PC Card device does not fully implement the PC Card multifunction standard, the vendor must provide the missing information in an INF file. There are two ways that a multifunction PC Card device might fail to implement the multifunction standard:

<OL>
	<LI>The device implements a set of multifunction configuration registers per function but does not contain the locations of all sets of registers in its attribute memory. </LI>

	<LI>The device does not implement a set of multifunction configuration registers per function. </LI>
</OL>

<P>If a device has the limitations listed above, the PCMCIA bus driver can program the configuration registers if the device's INF has the necessary information in <I>DDInstall</I>.<B>LogConfigOverride</B> section(s). See the following sections for further information:</P>

<P>Cardbus devices essentially follow the PCI multifunction rules. See <A HREF="mf-supp_2cpz.htm">Supporting Multifunction PCI Devices</A>. </P>
