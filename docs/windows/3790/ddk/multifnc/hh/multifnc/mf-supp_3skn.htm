<P>If a 16-bit, ISA-style PC Card device implements the PC Card multifunction standard completely and correctly, the vendor of such a device on an NT-based platform can rely on the following system-supplied components to handle the software aspects of the multifunction semantics:

<UL>
	<LI>An INF file for the multifunction device. (system-supplied)
<P>The PCMCIA bus driver specifies a hardware ID for the device that causes the Configuration Manager to use the system-supplied multifunction INF file (<I>mf.inf</I>) to configure the device. The <I>mf.inf</I> file specifies the class "MultiFunction" and its associated GUID (as defined in <I>devguid.h</I>).
</LI>

	<LI>A function driver for the multifunction device. (system-supplied)
<P>The <I>mf.inf</I> file specifies the system-supplied multifunction bus driver (<I>mf.sys</I>) as the function driver for the device.

<P>The <I>mf.sys</I> bus driver enumerates the functions of the device. The PCMCIA bus driver reads the configuration registers on the device to determine the resource requirements of each function. 

<P>See <A HREF="mf-supp_55rb.htm">Using the System-Supplied Multifunction Bus Driver</A> for more information on using the system-supplied <I>mf.sys</I> driver.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>The vendor of a multifunction PC Card device that conforms to the standard must provide the following support for the individual functions:

<UL>
	<LI>A PnP function driver for each function of the device. (vendor-supplied)
<P>Since the multifunction bus driver handles the multifunction semantics, the function drivers can be the same drivers that would be used if the functions were packaged as individual devices.
</LI>

	<LI>An INF file for each function of the device. (vendor-supplied)
<P>The INF files can be the same files that would be used if the functions were packaged as individual devices. The INF files do not need any special multifunction semantics.
</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Child Function Hardware IDs Created by the PCMCIA Bus Driver</H4>

<P>For a true multifunction PC Card device, the PCMCIA bus driver, together with <I>mf.sys</I>, creates hardware IDs for the child functions. Those IDs have the format:</P>

<PRE>    &lt;Manufacturer-name&gt;-&lt;Product-ID-string&gt;-DEV&lt;number&gt;-CRC</PRE>

<P>In this format, &lt;<I>number</I>&gt; is a zero-based number for the function.</P>

<P>For example, the PCMCIA bus driver creates child function hardware IDs such as the following:</P>

<PRE>    3COM_Corporation-3C562D/3C563D-DEV0-4893
    3COM_Corporation-3C562D/3C563D-DEV1-4893</PRE>

<P>An INF file for a child function of a multifunction PC Card device must specify the hardware ID that is reported by the PCMCIA bus driver and <I>mf.sys</I>. </P>
