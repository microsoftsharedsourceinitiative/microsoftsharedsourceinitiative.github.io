<P>Multimonitor support can be configured as multiple monitors, each connected to its own graphics adapter, or as multiple monitors connected to a single adapter that supports multiple outputs. Under either configuration, each display device can have a different size or position, and each device also can use a different color depth. </P>

<P>With multimonitor support, one monitor is the primary display and behaves the same as the VGA display under Windows® 95. The origin is at 0, 0 (upper left-hand corner) for the VGA device; other monitors can use negative origins (negative x, negative y, or negative x and y). System metrics and device capabilities refer to the primary display. The bounding rectangle is a virtual screen, but it does not need to be a rectangle. Each monitor has its own work area and can use different resolutions and different color depths. </P>
