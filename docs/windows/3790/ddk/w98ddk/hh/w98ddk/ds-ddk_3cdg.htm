<P>Mixing is one of the main features of DirectSound. Most games attempt to mix three to eight sounds simultaneously. Latency (the delay between playing the sound and hearing it through the speakers) must be less than 20 milliseconds for the listener to perceive sounds as being synchronized with visual cues. </P>

<P>The advantage of hardware mixing is that it reduces the load on the system CPU, allowing the game to run faster and smoother. However, it has the disadvantage of passing more data over the system bus. For a PCI sound card this is probably not a problem; the bandwidth of the PCI bus permits multiple streaming sound buffers to be simultaneously transmitted to the card without bus congestion. For an ISA card, hardware mixing is really only useful if the card has on-board memory (as described earlier) into which static sound buffers can be loaded. </P>

<P>DirectSound queries the sound card for its mixing capabilities. If the card has on-board memory and mixing, DirectSound uses that memory to store static sound buffers. If the card is on a fast bus (such as PCI), the driver can request DirectSound to also assign streaming buffers to the hardware mixing channels. DirectSound always reserves one mixing channel for the DirectSound software mixer so that additional streams can be mixed in software and then transmitted to the sound card for final mixing with the hardware buffers. </P>

<P>Each hardware mixing channel should support the following capabilities: 

<UL>
	<LI>Play and stop. </LI>

	<LI>Automatic looping back to start of buffer. </LI>

	<LI>Automatic stop at end of buffer if looping not specified. </LI>

	<LI>Should be able to stop after playing a specified number of bytes. If the number of bytes is greater than the length of the buffer, the buffer should automatically loop back to the beginning and continue until the specified number of bytes have been played. </LI>

	<LI>Volume and pan control. Most applications use these controls; if the hardware does not offer them, DirectSound is unable to use the hardware for these buffers. </LI>

	<LI>Frequency (pitch) control. This is also needed for the same reasons as volume and pan, but is not requested as often. </LI>
