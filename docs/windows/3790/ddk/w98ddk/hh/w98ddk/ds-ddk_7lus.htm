<P>As can be seen, the DirectSound API and the Wave APIs are alternative paths to the wave audio portion of the sound hardware. These two paths can (and should) coexist peacefully within a single driver. The VxD is simply required to fail an open request from one path if the device is already open through the other path. Therefore, if the device is allocated through the Wave APIs, the DirectSound allocation must fail.Similarly if the device is allocated through DirectSound, the Wave allocation must fail. It is critical that this contention management be performed correctly; if it is not, the new driver has the potential to create compatibility problems with existing applications that access the Wave APIs. </P>
