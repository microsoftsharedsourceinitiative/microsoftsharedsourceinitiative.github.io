<P>This function breaks an existing network connection. It may also be used to remove a persistent connection for which there is no existing network connection. </P>

<P>When <B>WNetCancelConnection2</B> is called it removes the connection entirely if it is to a redirected local device or a non-reference counted session, or if CONNECT_REFCOUNT bit is not set in the <I>dwFlags</I> parameter. Otherwise <B>WNetCancelConnection2</B> decrements the reference count to the session and removes the session when it is no longer being referenced. </P>

<DT><I>lpName</I> </DT>

<DD>The name of either the redirected local device or the remote network resource to disconnect from. In the former case, only the redirection specified is broken, in the latter case only the deviceless connection to the remote network resource is broken. If <B>WNetUseConnection</B> was called to make the connection with a non-empty <I>lpLocalName</I> field, then <I>lpName</I> is set to this, otherwise it should be the name that was returned in the <I>lpAccessName</I> field. </DD>

<DD>This is a bit mask which may have any of the following bits set: 

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=57%>If the disconnection should remain persistent. If set, Windows will no longer restore this connection when the user logs on. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>CONNECT_REFCOUNT </TD>
<TD width=57%>If this bit is not set, the connection is to a redirected local device, or the connection is not reference counted, then the connection is cancelled completely (which will interfere with other threads or processes that are using the connection). If this bit is set and the connection supports reference counts then the reference count to the connection is descremented. When nothing is referencing the connection it is cancelled. </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

</DD>

<DT><I>fForce</I> </DT>

<DD>Used to indicate if the disconnect should be done forcefully in the event of open files or jobs on the connection. If FALSE is specified, the call will fail if there are open files or jobs. If TRUE is specified, then CONNECT_REFCOUNT must not be set in <I>dwFlags</I>. </DD>
</DL>

<UL>
	<LI>WN_SUCCESS if the call is successful. If the connection does not exist for any of the NPs but is persistent and the MPR successfully deleted the persistent connection, this is treated as a successful call. Other error codes include: </LI>
