<P>The DIB Engine's software cursor supports mouse trails. To use this, a driver needs to make sure that it chains escape calls to the DIB Engine to allow activation and deactivation of mouse trails. In addition, drivers with hardware cursors need to know when to shift to the DIB Engine's cursor to make mouse trails visible. This is done by hooking the mouse trail escape call. On the mouse trails escape, the driver may need to switch from hardware to software cursor. </P>
