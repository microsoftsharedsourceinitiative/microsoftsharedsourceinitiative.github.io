<P>A multifunction card is any card which is enumerated as a single device but is actually more than one device on a single card. Typical would be a sound card which is a CD-ROM interface and a sound controller on the same card. During installation, the device installer will execute both the install section for this device and the InstallSection.HW as described previously. The following special <B>HW</B> section items have been created for multifunction devices: 

<UL>
	<LI>HardwareID List </LI>

	<LI>Resource Map </LI>
</UL>

<P>A HardwareID List item is a text item that is added with an AddReg-type section. Hardware ID items cause the Configuration Manager to create devnodes for every HardwareID item used. The Configuration Manager enumerates these devices. An example HardwareID item looks like this: </P>

<PRE>HKR,Child0000,HardwareID,,MF\ID
 </PRE>

<P>A Resource Map item is used in an INF file when installing an EISA multifunction card. Resources are not really assigned to the parent but rather to the independent functions. The EISA enumerator, however, reports only the parent device and reports all resources as belonging to the common parent. A Resource Map item tells the Configuration Manager how to divide the parent resource between the children. The resource map is a binary format record added using an AddReg-type entry, where each byte represents the ordinal of the EISA resource record belonging to the child. This is not a bit map, it is a list of ordinals. There is a limit of 256 EISA ordinal values. An example Resource Map item looks like this: </P>
