<P>You can use the system heap to allocate memory objects of any size, rather than allocating in units of pages. </P>

<P>To allocate a memory object on the heap, use the <B>_HeapAllocate</B> service. You can change the size of the memory object using the <B>_HeapReAllocate</B> service and free it using the <B>_HeapFree</B> service. To determine the size of a memory object, use the <B>_HeapGetSize</B> service. </P>

<P>There are three system heaps: the locked heap, the swappable heap, and the init heap. The init heap is discarded at the end of <B>Init_Complete</B>. The locked and swappable heaps remain available as long as the system is running. Memory allocated into the swappable heap is swappable; your VxD must be careful not to access it at a time when paging is not allowed. </P>

<P>The system provides no memory protection for memory objects on the heap. It also does not compact the heap. Therefore, virtual devices should avoid using the heap in such a way as to severely fragment it. </P>
