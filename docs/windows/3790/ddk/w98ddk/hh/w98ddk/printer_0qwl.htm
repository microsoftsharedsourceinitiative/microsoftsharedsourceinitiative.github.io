<P>The driver must deal with brushes differently than in Windows 3.x. After an <B>Enable</B> function call, GDI calls the driver <B>RealizeObject</B> function twice with an OBJ_BRUSH argument: the first time to get size information and the second time to realize the brush. Under Windows 3.x the driver returned only a TRUE or FALSE value on the second call. Under Windows 95, upon success, the driver must return a WORD with two or more of the following bits set: </P>

<P>For example, if a solid white brush was realized, for a monochrome DC the driver must return PBF_SUCCESS+PBF_SOLIDMONOBRUSH. For a color DC the driver must return PBF_SUCCESS+PBF_SOLIDCLRBRUSH. This is because a solid white brush is not dithered in either monochrome or color. </P>

<P>If, for example, a solid red brush was realized, for a monochrome DC the driver must return PBF_SUCCESS. This is because a red brush is dithered in monochrome. For a color DC, when a solid red brush is realized, the driver must return SUCCESS+PBF_SOLIDCLR. </P>

<P>Note that if the driver fails to realize the brush, it should still return FALSE. </P>
