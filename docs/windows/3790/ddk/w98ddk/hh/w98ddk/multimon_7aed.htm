<P>Users can freely mix and match display hardware because the graphics adapters don't need to be identical. Each display device and monitor combination is enumerated and configured separately and can have completely different hardware characteristics. This means that each monitor can have different x,y resolutions and different color depths. Hardware that supports multimonitor capabilities includes:

<UL>
	<LI>Non-VGA displays</LI>

	<LI>Graphics adapters with multiple outputs</LI>

	<LI>PCI graphics adapters (classes 0380, 0301, and so on)</LI>

	<LI>PCI VGA graphics adapters (class 0300)</LI>
</UL>

<P>The basic required features for hardware that supports multimonitor capabilities include the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Can operate with VGA off.</LI>

	<LI>Can use memory-mapped input/output (MMIO) or relocatable I/O.</LI>

	<LI>Can use linear frame buffer.</LI>

	<LI>Has no VGA I/O accesses.</LI>

	<LI>Has no A000 – B000 resource usage.</LI>
</UL>

<P>With multimonitor support, the operating system still needs a VGA device, which becomes the primary display. The basic input/output system (BIOS) picks the VGA device based on slot order,  unless the BIOS offers an option for picking which device is to be treated as the VGA device. Notice also that the VGA device cannot be stopped, which is an important consideration for docking units.</P>
