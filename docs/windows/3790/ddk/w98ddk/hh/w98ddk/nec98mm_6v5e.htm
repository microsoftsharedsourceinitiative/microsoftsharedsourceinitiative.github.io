<P>During setup, display adapters are detected in the order of primary priority, and the first display adapter found is loaded set as the primary display adapter. </P>

<P>When upgrading, the display adapter in use is set as the primary display adapter.</P>

<P>If a new display adapter is detected after a new display adapter is inserted, it is set as the primary display adapter and all other drivers are set as secondary display adapters. However, the setting that determines if it is used as a desktop remains.</P>

<P>As a result, the display adapter that was used as a primary display adapter is now a secondary display adapter. If this is exclusively a primary display adapter, such as the internal accelerator, its ability to be used as the desktop is automatically disabled (“!” is displayed in the device manager).</P>

<H4>Abnormalities</H4>

<P>When a display adapter that was stored in memory as a primary display adapter does not exist (for example, the display card has been removed), it starts up in fallback mode. (In fallback mode, the display adapter starts in Fail Safe mode display driver (640x400 16 color; 640x480 expected in Windows 98) and the hardware wizard boots the system.</P>

<P>If several display adapters are stored in memory as primary display adapters, the first one reported by Plug and Play is designated as the primary display adapter and the rest become secondary display adapters.</P>
