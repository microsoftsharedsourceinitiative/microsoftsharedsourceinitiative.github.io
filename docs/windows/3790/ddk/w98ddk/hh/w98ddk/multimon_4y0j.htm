<H2><A NAME="_multimon_failure_codes"></A>Failure Codes</H2>

<P>If a display device fails to start, usually indicated by a yellow '!' in the device manager (and usually a code 10 error code in the device manager), the VDD writes a more detailed error code in the registry. This code is contained in the hardware key of the display device ( <B>HKLM\Enum\PCI\deviceid\instance</B>). The following failure codes are provided:

<DL>
<DT>FAIL_ANOTHER_VGA</DT>

<DD>Plug and Play subsystem allocated VGA resources to two devices.</DD>

<DT>FAIL_BAD_NUM_UNITS</DT>

<DD>GET_NUM_UNITS return value from the miniVDD was invalid (usually too large).</DD>

<DT>FAIL_BIGROM</DT>

<DD>After-POST size of the display BIOS is greater than 64K.</DD>

<DT>FAIL_BIGROMDP</DT>

<DD>VDD shows this error if the after-POST BIOS size is greater than 64K, and paging is using MS-DOS. </DD>

<DT>FAIL_CANT_OFF_VGA</DT>

<DD>After disabling the device, the VDD detected that the device was still decoding VGA resources. Multimonitor support requires that all PCI devices be capable of being disabled through PCI or the <A HREF="multimon_1ko6.htm"><B>TURN_VGA_OFF</B></A> function. </DD>

<DT>FAIL_CANT_READ_ROM</DT>

<DD>Common error with display devices on system motherboards. The system ROM has disabled the ROM of the device, but not the device itself. The VDD tries to POST the device, but it cannot read the ROM, usually off of the motherboard. In motherboard display systems, the VDD will write the ROM image to the registry if it can read the ROM.  On motherboard display systems, the only way to read the ROM, in most cases, is to boot Windows 98 with the motherboard display as the only display system. The VDD then writes the ROM image to the registry. When it tries to POST the device and cannot read the ROM itself, the VDD gets the ROM image out of the registry. </DD>

<DT>FAIL_ISA_VGA</DT>

<DD>Some or all devices were detected as ISA devices. Multimonitor support assumes that all secondary devices are PCI devices. </DD>

<DT>FAIL_MINIVDD</DT>

<DD>MiniVDD returned an error when trying to load.</DD>

<DT>FAIL_MINIVDD_VGA</DT>

<DD>MiniVDD hooked a call that is reserved for the miniVDD of the main VGA device.</DD>

<DT>FAIL_NO_DRV2</DT>

<DD>Device has not started because there is no DRV2 entry in the software key of the registry..</DD>

<DT>FAIL_NON_PHYS_C000</DT>

<DD>Display BIOS does not exist at C000-C7FF.</DD>

<DT>FAIL_NONE</DT>

<DD>Fail code when the device is operating properly.</DD>

<DT>FAIL_POST_ASD</DT>

<DD>POST=0 is in the software key of the device, meaning that the last time the VDD tried to POST the device, it failed, hung the machine, or crashed the machine.</DD>

<DT>FAIL_TOO_LATE</DT>

<DD>VDD has started the system and it cannot start the main VGA after Windows has been started. This usually happens when the main Windows device is not a VGA and a VGA card is enabled by the user as a secondary display.</DD>

<DT>FAIL_VGA_NOT_PCI</DT>

<DD>Device was started, but it was detected as not being on a PCI bus.

</DD>
