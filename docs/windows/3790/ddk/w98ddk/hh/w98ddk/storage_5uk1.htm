<P>When the Level 3 lock is taken, the IFS manager issues a CLOSE_FINAL on all open handles for the corresponding volume. It also passes in the FILE_CLOSE_FOR_LEVEL3_LOCK flag in ir_options to indicate this to the FSD. In this case, the FSD should not free the record locks on the file as it would normally. Instead, it should just return a pointer to the list of active record locks for the file. This pointer is then passed in on the FS_OpenFile call when the IFS manager reopens the file for access. </P>
