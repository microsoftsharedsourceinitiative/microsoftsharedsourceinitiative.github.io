<P>The ISAPNP, EISA, PCI, PCMCIA and MCA bus types are enumerated explicitly by Configuration Manager. (MicroChannel is not hardware enumerated at this time, but it is in this list in case this is added in future releases.) Because of this characteristic, Setup needs to handle manual installations of these cards differently than legacy ISA cards. Ideally, these cards should be installed by simply plugging the card in and turning the computer on. The system automatically detects the card and its configuration, and installs it. However, it is possible to manually install the device through the New Hardware or Net Setup Control Panel. Special code was added to handle this situation. In order to invoke this code, a keyword needs to be added to the .inf file for these cards. The keyword is CardType, and the options are PCMCIA, EISA, PCI, ISAPNP, or MCA. The following example illustrates it's use: </P>

<P>Look at the .inf files that are included with Windows 95 to get an idea of where you want to place this line. </P>
