 </PRE>

<DL>
<DT><I>hwndOwner</I> </DT>

<DD>A handle to a window which should be the owner for any messages or dialogs the network provider might display. This is used if CONNECT_INTERACTIVE is set. </DD>

<DT><I>lpNetResource</I> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the network resource to connect to. This structure is defined the section describing Enumeration APIs. The following fields must be set when making a connection, the others are ignored. 

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%><I>lpRemoteName</I> </TD>
<TD width=57%>Specifies the network resource to connect to. This is limited to MAX_PATH. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%><I>lpLocalName</I> </TD>
<TD width=57%>Pointer to a buffer that specifies the local device name that is to be redirected, such as "F:" or "LPT1". </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD width=57%>The string is treated in a case insensitive manner, and may be the empty string (or NULL) in which case a connection to the network resource is made without making a redirection. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%><I>lpProvider</I> </TD>
<TD width=57%>Specifies the NP to connect to. If NULL or empty string, Windows will try each NP in turn. The caller should set <I>lpProvider </I>only if it knows for sure which network it wants. Otherwise, it is preferable to let Windows determine which NP the network name maps to. If this is non NULL, Windows will try the named NP and no other. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%><I>dwType</I> </TD>
<TD width=57%>Specifies the type of resource to connect to. It must be RESOURCETYPE_DISK or RESOURCETYPE_PRINT if <I>lpLocalName</I> is not the empty string. It may also be RESOURCETYPE_ANY if <I>lpLocalName</I> is the empty string. </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

</DD>

<DT><I>lpPassword</I> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the password to be used in making the connection, normally the password associated with <I>lpUserID</I>. A NULL value or string may be passed in to not specify the password. If the password is invalid or not specified, then the function tries to use the current default password. If this fails and CONNECT_INTERACTIVE is set, the function posts an appropriate dialog asking the user to type/retype the password. </DD>

<DT><I>lpUserID</I> </DT>

<DD>This specifies the identity of the user needed to make the connection. If NULL, a default will be applied. This is used when the user wishes to connect to a resource, but has a different user name or account assigned to him for that resource. This identification represents a security context, and is NP specific. 

<P>This user specific information is stored to be subsequently used in re-establishing the connection (using a non-default user name or telephone number, for example). 
</DD>

<DT><I>dwFlags</I> </DT>

<DD>Any combination of the following values: 

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>CONNECT_UPDATE_PROFILE </TD>
<TD width=57%>If the connection should be made persistent. If set, the connection is automatically restored every time the user starts up and logs on to the network. A connection is only made persistent if the connection was successful. This flag is only valid if <I>lpLocalName</I> specifies a local device to redirect. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>CONNECT_UPDATE_RECENT </TD>
<TD width=57%>If the connection should be put in the recent connection list. If set, and the connection is successfully added, it will be put in the recent connection list. This flag should typically have the opposite value to CONNECT_TEMPORARY. </TD>
