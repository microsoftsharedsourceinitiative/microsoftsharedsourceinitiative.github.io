<H3><A NAME="_pss_4174"></A>Resolution of ISO 9660 Ambiguities for Wide Characters</H3>

<P>This specification resolves ISO 9660 ambiguities with respect to wide (16-bit) character sets, such as the UCS-2 character set. </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4175"></A>Wide Character Byte Ordering</H4>

<P>All UCS-2 characters shall be recorded according to ISO 9660:1988 Section 7.2.2, 16-bit numerical value, most significant byte first ("Big Endian"). </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4176"></A>Allowed Character Set</H4>

<P>All UCS-2 code points shall be allowed except for the following UCS-2 code points: </P>

<P>All code points between (00)(00) and (00)(1F), inclusive. (Control Characters) </P>

<P>(00)(2A) "*"(Asterisk) </P>

<P>(00)(2F) "/" (Forward Slash) </P>

<P>(00)(3A) ":" (Colon) </P>

<P>(00)(3B) ";" (Semicolon) </P>

<P>(00)(3F) "?" (Question Mark) </P>

<P>(00)(5C) "\" (Backslash) </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4177"></A>Special Directory Identifiers</H4>

<P>Section 7.6 of ISO 9660 describes the recording of reserved directory identifiers for the root, current, and parent directory identifiers as single (00) or single (01) bytes. </P>

<P>In a wide character set, it is not possible to represent a character in a single byte. The following portions of the ISO 9660:1988 specification referring to reserved directory identifiers are ambiguous. </P>

<P>The ISO 9660:1988 sections in question are as follows: 

<UL>
	<LI>6.8.2.2 Identification of directories </LI>

	<LI>7.6.2 Reserved Directory Identifiers </LI>

	<LI>9.1.11 File Identifier </LI>

	<LI>9.4.5 Directory Identifier </LI>
</UL>

<P>These special case directory identifiers are not intended to represent characters in a graphic character set. These characters are placeholders, not characters. Therefore, these definitions remain unchanged on a volume recorded in Unicode. </P>

<P>Simply put, Special Directory Identifiers shall remain as 8-bit values, even on a UCS-2 volume, where other characters have been expanded to 16-bits. </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4178"></A>Root Directory</H4>

<P>The Directory Identifier of a Directory Record describing the Root Directory shall consist of a single (00) byte. </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4179"></A>Current Directory</H4>

<P>The Directory Identifier of the first Directory Record of each directory shall consist of a single (00) byte. </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4180"></A>Parent Directory</H4>

<P>The Directory Identifier of the second Directory Record of each directory shall consist of a single (01) byte. </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4181"></A>Separator Characters</H4>

<P>The separator characters SEPARATOR 1 and SEPARATOR 2 are specified as 8-bit characters, which can not be represented in a wide character set, so the ISO 9660:1988 specification sections referring to SEPARATOR 1 and SEPARATOR 2 are ambiguous. The ISO 9660:1988 sections in question are as follows: 

<UL>
	<LI>7.4.3 Separators </LI>

	<LI>7.5.1 File Identifier format </LI>

	<LI>7.5.2 File Identifier length </LI>

	<LI>8.4.24 Abstract File Identifier </LI>

	<LI>8.4.25 Bibliographic File Identifier </LI>

	<LI>8.5.17 Copyright File Identifier </LI>

	<LI>8.5.19 Bibliographic File Identifier </LI>

	<LI>9.1.11 File Identifier </LI>
</UL>

<P>The values SEPARATOR 1 and SEPARATOR 2 shall be represented differently depending on the d1 character set. </P>

<P>In the case of an SVD identifying a UCS-2 character set, the values of SEPARATOR 1 and SEPARATOR 2 shall be recorded as a UCS-2 character with an equivalent code point value. </P>

<P>Otherwise, the definitions of SEPARATOR 1 and SEPARATOR 2 shall be recorded according to Section 7.4.3 of ISO 9660:1988. </P>

<P>Simply put, SEPARATOR 1 and SEPARATOR 2 shall be expanded to 16-bits. </P>

<H4><A NAME="_pss_4182"></A>Sort Ordering</H4>

<P>ISO 9660 specifies the order of path table records within a path table, and specifies the order of directory records within a directory. These sorting algorithms assume an 8-bit character set is used. These sorting algorithms are ambiguous when used with wide characters. </P>

<P>The ISO 9660:1988 sections in question are as follows: 

<UL>
	<LI>6.9.1 Order of Path Table Records </LI>

	<LI>9.3 Order of Directory Records </LI>
</UL>

<P>The only change required is to redefine the value of the sort justification pad byte to zero (00). </P>

<P>Simply put, comparing the byte contents in all positions remains a suitable sorting algorithm for the descriptor fields recorded in a UCS-2 SVD Directory Hierarchy. This is one of the primary reasons for selecting the Big Endian format to represent all UCS-2 characters. </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4183"></A>Natural Language Sorting</H4>

<P>On a Unicode volume, the 16-bit UCS-2 code points are used to determine the Order of Path Table Records and the Order of Directory Records. </P>

<P>No attempt will be made to provide natural language sorting on the media. Natural language sorting may optionally be provided by a display application as desired. </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4184"></A>Justification Pad Bytes</H4>

<P>The sort ordering algorithms as specified in ISO 9660:1988 Sections 6.9.1 and 9.3 are acceptable except for the value of the justification "pad byte". </P>

<P>The value of the justification "pad byte" as specified in ISO 9660:1988 Section 6.9.1 shall be (00). This is changed from a value of (20) as specified in that same section. </P>

<P>The value of the justification "pad byte" as specified in ISO 9660:1988 Section 9.3 subsections (a) and (b) shall be (00). This is changed from a value of (20) as specified in those same sections. </P>

<P>The value of the justification "pad byte" as specified in ISO 9660:1988 Section 9.3 subsections (c) shall be (00). This is changed from a value of (30) as specified in that same section. </P>

<P>Simply put, set all the justification "pad bytes" to zero to simplify sorting. </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4185"></A>Mandatory Sort Ordering.</H4>

<P>Correct sort ordering is mandatory on UCS-2 volumes. </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4186"></A>Descriptor Fields affected by the UCS-2 Escape Sequence</H4>

<P>If a UCS-2 escape sequence is detected in a supplementary volume descriptor, the following descriptor fields referenced from that supplementary volume descriptor shall contain UCS-2 characters. </P>

<P>ISO 9660:1988 Section 8.5.4 System Identifier </P>

<P>ISO 9660:1988 Section 8.5.5 Volume Identifier </P>

<P>ISO 9660:1988 Section 8.5.13 Volume Set Identifier </P>

<H4><A NAME="_pss_4187"></A>Relaxation of ISO 9660 Restrictions on UCS-2 Volumes</H4>

<P>Several ISO 9660 restrictions will be relaxed to achieve a more useful recording specification. Joliet receiving systems shall be capable of receiving media recorded with restrictions which have been relaxed relative to ISO 9660. </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4188"></A>Maximum File Identifier Length Increased</H4>

<P>Joliet receiving systems shall receive directory hierarchies recorded with file identifiers longer than those allowed by ISO 9660 receiving systems. </P>

<P>ISO 9660 (Section 7.5.1) states that the sum of the following shall not exceed 30: 

<UL>
	<LI>If there is a file name, the length of the file name. </LI>

	<LI>If there is a file name extension, the length of the file name extension. </LI>
</UL>

<P>On Joliet compliant media, however, the sum as calculated above shall not exceed 128, to allow for longer file identifiers. </P>

<P>The above lengths shall be expressed as a number of bytes. </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4189"></A>Maximum Directory Identifier Length Increased</H4>

<P>Joliet receiving systems shall receive directory hierarchies recorded with file names longer than those allowed by ISO 9660 receiving systems. </P>

<P>ISO 9660 (Section 7.6.3) states that the length of a directory identifier shall not exceed 31. </P>

<P>On Joliet compliant media, however, the length of a directory identifier shall not exceed 128, to allow for longer directory identifiers. </P>

<P>The above lengths shall be expressed as a number of bytes. </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4190"></A>Directory Names May Have File Name Extensions</H4>

<P>ISO 9660 does not allow directory identifiers to contain file name extensions. </P>

<P>On Joliet compliant media, however, directory identifiers may contain file name extensions. </P>

<P>The Joliet directory identifier format shall be calculated according to ISO 9660 Section 7.5.1 "File Identifier format", with the exception that the length of a directory identifier may exceed 31, but shall not exceed 128. </P>

<P>In addition, the Joliet directory identifier format shall comply with ISO 9660 Section 7.6.2 "Reserved Directory Identifiers". </P>

<P>The directory identifier length shall be calculated according to ISO 9660 Section 7.5.2 "File Identifier length". </P>

<P>The above lengths shall be expressed as a number of bytes. </P>



<H4><A NAME="_pss_4191"></A>Maximum Directory Hierarchy Depth May Exceed 8 Levels</H4>

<P>ISO 9660 (Section 6.8.2.1) specifies restrictions regarding the Depth of Directory Hierarchy. This section of ISO 9660 specifies that this number of levels in the hierarchy shall not exceed eight. </P>

<P>On Joliet compliant media, however, the number of levels in the hierarchy may exceed eight. </P>

<P>Joliet compliant media shall comply with the remainder of ISO 9660 Section 6.8.2.1, so that for each file recorded, the sum of the following shall not exceed 240: 

<UL>
	<LI>the length of the file identifier; </LI>

	<LI>the length of the directory identifiers of all relevant directories; </LI>

	<LI>the number of relevant directories. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The above lengths shall be expressed as a number of bytes. </P>
