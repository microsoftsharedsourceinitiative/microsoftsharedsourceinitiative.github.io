<DL>
<DT><I>cbStructure</I> </DT>

<DD>The size of the <B>NOTIFYADD</B> structure in bytes. </DD>

<DT><I>hwndOwner</I> </DT>

<DD>A handle to a window which should be the owner for any messages or dialog boxes the NP might display. This is only used if CONNECT_INTERACTIVE is set in <I>dwAddFlags</I>. </DD>

<DT><I>NetResource</I> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the network resource to connect to. The following fields are valid: 

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%><I>lpRemoteName</I> </TD>
<TD width=57%>The name of the network resource. If this parameter is a pointer to an empty string, then access has been attempted to the entire network, such as when starting browsing to a network. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%><I>lpLocalName</I> </TD>
<TD width=57%>This specifies the name of a local device to be redirected, such as "F:" or "LPT1". The string is treated in a case-insensitive manner. <I>lpLocalName</I> may be a pointer to an empty string in which case, if <I>lpRemoteName</I> is pointer to a non-empty string, a connection to a network resource is being made without making a redirection. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%><I>lpProvider</I> </TD>
<TD width=57%>On pre-notification, specifies which NPs the connect operation was applied to. If a pointer to an empty string, then MPR has tried all valid providers. On post-notification, if the add operation was successful, specifies the name of the NP that performed the add operation. </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

</DD>

<DT><I>dwType</I> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the type of resource connected. It is RESOURCETYPE_DISK or RESOURCETYPE_PRINT if <I>lpLocalName</I> is a pointer to a non-empty string. It may also be RESOURCETYPE_ANY if <I>lpLocalName</I> is a pointer to an empty string and the connection attempt has failed. </DD>

<DT><I>dwAddFlags</I> </DT>

<DD>A combination of the following values: 

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>CONNECT_TEMPORARY </TD>
<TD width=57%>The connection is being established for browsing purposes and will probably be released quickly. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>CONNECT_INTERACTIVE </TD>
<TD width=57%>May have interaction with the user. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>CONNECT_PROMPT </TD>
<TD width=57%>Do no use any defaults without offering user the chance to supply an alternative. This flag is only valid if CONNECT_INTERACTIVE is set. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>CONNECT_UPDATE_PROFILE </TD>
<TD width=57%>If the connection is being made persistent. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>CONNECT_UPDATE_RECENT </TD>
<TD width=57%>If the connection is being put in the recent connection list. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>CONNECT_REDIRECT </TD>
<TD width=57%>If set, force the auto-picking of a local device for redirection when making the connection, otherwise only auto-pick a local device for redirection if the network requires it to make a connection. </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

</DD>

<DT><I>lpAccessName</I> </DT>

<DD>Pointer to buffer to receive the name that can be used to make system requests on the connection. </DD>

<DT><I>lpBufferSize</I> </DT>

<DD>The size of the <I>lpAccessName</I> buffer. </DD>

<DT><I>dwResult</I> </DT>

<DD>Returned information about the connection. </DD>

<DT><I>dwAddContext</I> </DT>

<DD>The context under which the add is being made, a combination of the following values: 

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>CONNECT_CTXT_RESTORE </TD>
<TD width=57%>The connection is being established to restore a persistent connection. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>CONNECT_CTXT_GLOBAL </TD>
<TD width=57%>All persistent connections are being restored. This flag is only valid if CONNECT_CTXT_ RESTORE is set. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>CONNECT_CTXT_PROVIDER </TD>
<TD width=57%>The persistent connections for a specific network alone are being restored. This flag is only valid if CONNECT_CTXT_ RESTORE is set. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>CONNECT_CTXT_SINGLE </TD>
<TD width=57%>An individual persistent connection is being restored. This flag is only valid if CONNECT_CTXT_ RESTORE is set. </TD>
