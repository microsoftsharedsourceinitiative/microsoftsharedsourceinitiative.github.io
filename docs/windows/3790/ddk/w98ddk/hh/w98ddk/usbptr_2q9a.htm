<P>To create USB or kernel-mode HID client drivers, refer to the Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;2000 DDK documentation. USB and HID client drivers that conform to the Windows Driver Model (WDM) are source-compatible for Windows&nbsp;98, Windows Millennium Edition (Windows&nbsp;Me), and Windows&nbsp;2000 systems, provided they use only the system support routines that are declared in wdm.h.</P>

<P>However, source compatibility does not guarantee that an HID or USB driver will function properly on all WDM systems. Drivers should be thoroughly tested on all systems on which they are intended to run.</P>

<P>There are also significant differences in the Windows&nbsp;2000 and Windows&nbsp;Me input architectures. Readers are referred to the next section for a discussion of the Windows&nbsp;Me input architecture.</P>
