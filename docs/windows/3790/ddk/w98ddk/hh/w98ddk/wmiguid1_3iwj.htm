<P>The port driver will also support WMI event notification. The new notification type, WMIEvent, will be added to <B>ScsiPortNotification</B>. The third argument to <B>ScsiPortNotification</B> is a pointer to the WMI event and the fourth argument should be the size of that event.  The fifth argument is 0xFF if the event is for the adapter, or the <I>PathId</I> of the event's target device. If the event is for a target device, arguments six and seven will be the <I>TargetId</I> and <I>Lun</I> of the device.</P>

<P>Note that the miniport driver cannot post events that have not been previously enabled. Also, if events are posted too quickly, some of them might be lost.</P>

<P>The miniport can indicate to WMI that the data items it supports have changed by calling <B>ScsiPortNotification</B> with a notification type of WMIReregister. This notification can be used if the number of instances that a miniport supports have changed. The third argument should be 0xFF if the adapter is being reregistered, or the <I>PathId</I> of the target device being reregistered.  If the notification is for a target device, the fourth and fifth arguments should be the <I>TargetId</I> and <I>Lun</I> of that device.</P>
