<P>Sent to an Audio Compression Manager (ACM) driver to request details about a filter for a specific filter tag. This message is usually sent to an ACM driver in response to an <B>acmFilterDetails</B> or <B>acmFilterEnum</B> call. 

<UL>
	<LI>Returns MMSYSERR_NOERROR if successful or an error value otherwise. The following errors are possible: </LI>

<DD>Address of the <B>ACMFILTERDETAILS</B> structure that should be filled in with the filter details for the specified filter tag.

<DD>Flags for getting the filter details for the specified filter tag. This parameter is identical to the <I>fdwDetails</I> parameter passed to <B>acmFilterDetails</B>.

<TD width=63%>Indicates that a <B>WAVEFILTER</B> structure pointed to by <B>pwfltr</B> of the <B>ACMFILTERDETAILS</B> structure was given and the remaining details should be returned. The <B>dwFilterTag</B> member of the <B>ACMFILTERDETAILS</B> will be initialized to the same filter tag as the <B>pwfltr</B> member specifies. This query type can be used to get a string description of an arbitrary filter structure. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=37%>ACM_FILTERDETAILSF_INDEX </TD>
<TD width=63%>Indicates that a filter index for the filter tag was given in the <B>dwFilterIndex</B> member of the <B>ACMFILTERDETAILS</B> structure. The filter details must be returned in the structure specified by <I>lParam1</I>.

<P>An ACM driver that supports filter operations must support this message. If a driver does not support filters, this message should not be handled (MMSYSERR_NOTSUPPORTED must be returned). Note that the following parameters for the ACMDM_FILTER_DETAILS message will be validated before calling the driver: 

<UL>
	<LI>The <I>lParam1</I> parameter will contain a valid pointer to an <B>ACMFILTERDETAILS</B> structure with the proper members initialized for the requested query operation. This structure will be at least the size of the base <B>ACMFILTERDETAILS</B> structure. </LI>

	<LI>The <B>cbStruct</B> member of the <B>ACMFILTERDETAILS</B> structure will be set to at least the size in bytes of the base <B>ACMFILTERDETAILS</B> structure. </LI>

	<LI><B>WAVEFILTER</B> structure that is at least the size, in bytes, specified in the <B>cbwfltr</B> member of the <B>ACMFILTERDETAILS</B> structure. </LI>

	<LI>No invalid flag combinations will be specified in <I>lParam2</I>. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The driver does not need to check for these conditions. </P>

<P>To enable the driver to successfully query for the filter of the specified filter tag, the <B>cbStruct</B> member of the <B>ACMFILTERDETAILS</B> structure should be set to the actual size, in bytes, of the details being returned. This size cannot exceed the requested size. Note that the smallest possible size is the size of the base <B>ACMFILTERDETAILS</B> structure. </P>
