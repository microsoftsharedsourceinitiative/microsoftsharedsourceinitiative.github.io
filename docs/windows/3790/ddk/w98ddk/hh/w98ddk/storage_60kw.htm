<P>This function is called by the FSD on completion of an asynchronous read or write operation. The IFS manager then decides what is to be done based on the information contained in the IOREQ. To indicate that the FSD is doing asynchronous processing, it has to return a special STATUS_PENDING error code on the call to perform the operation.

<DD>Supplies the Ioreq that was initially passed to the FSD to initiate the asynchronous operation. This Ioreq must be the one that is passed back. The fields of the Ioreq were filled in by the IFS manager according to the operation that was performed. </DD>
