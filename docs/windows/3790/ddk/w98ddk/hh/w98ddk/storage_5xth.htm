<P>This service is provided for supporting volume locking. FSDs that do not allow direct disk I/O and consequently volume locking, do not need to make use of this service. Under the volume locking scheme, the IFS manager "temporarily" closes all open files on the volume when a Level 3 lock is taken. These files are later reopened by the IFS manager when there is an access to them. If such an open file has active locks, they need to be restored when the file is reopened. To facilitate this, this service walks the entire list of locks and marks them inactive instead of freeing them. Later, when the file is reopened by the IFS manager, the locks are reinstated by calling IFSMgr_ReassignLockFileInst. The FSD is passed a special status on this "virtual close" operation on a Level 3 lock. The FSD needs to look for this status and at that time call this service instead of calling IFSMgr_RemoveLocks to remove the locks.
