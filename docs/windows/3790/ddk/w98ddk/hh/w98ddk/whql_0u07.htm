<P>Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) distributes Windows® 95 compatibility tests (CTs) and instructions for using them. Third-party engineers use the CTs to test hardware devices and drivers at their site before submitting them to WHQL for compatibility testing. All the compatibility tests are used by WHQL during the testing process at Microsoft Corporation. </P>

<P>The CTs are not included on this release of the Windows 95 DDK, and you must <I>not </I> use any of the CTs distributed on either of the two previous releases of the Windows 95 DDK. </P>
