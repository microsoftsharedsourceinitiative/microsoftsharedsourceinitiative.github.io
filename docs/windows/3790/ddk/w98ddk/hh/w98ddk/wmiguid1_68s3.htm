<P>When the driver receives an IRP_MN_ENABLE_EVENTS, the driver should verify that the GUID pointed to by the <B>DataPath</B> is a valid GUID representing an event and, if so, enable the event and complete the IRP. Support for this IRP is required for all drivers that support generating events.</P>

<P>WMI will manage any reference counting issues in the case that multiple data consumers have requested notification for events associated with the data item. The driver should not expect a second enable without having received an intervening disable. Also, a driver only needs to generate an event once; WMI will ensure that any data consumer who has registered for that event notification will receive the event.</P>
