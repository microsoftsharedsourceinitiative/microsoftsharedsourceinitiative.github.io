<P>Depending on how the client-application will use the decompressed data, it will send either ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT or ICM_DECOMPRESS_QUERY to specify the input format and determine the decompression format. The client-application sends ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT if it wants your driver to suggest the decompressed format. The client-application sends ICM_DECOMPRESS_QUERY to determine if your driver supports a format it is suggesting. </P>

<P>Both messages send a pointer to a BITMAPINFO data structure in <I>dwParam1</I>. This structure specifies the format of the incoming compressed data. The input format was obtained by the client-application from the 'strf' chunk in the AVI file. While the output format is specified by <I>dwParam2</I>, your driver must use the message to determine how the parameter is defined. </P>

<P>If your driver gets ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT, both <I>dwParam1</I> and <I>dwParam2</I> point to BITMAPINFO data structures. The input format data is contained in the <I>dwParam1</I> structure. Your driver should fill in the <I>dwParam2</I> BITMAPINFO with information about the format it will use to decompress the data. If your driver can handle the format, return the number of bytes used for the <I>dwParam2</I> structure as the return value. If your driver cannot handle the input format, or the input format from the 'strf' chunk is incorrect, your driver should return ICERR_BADFORMAT to fail the message. </P>

<P>If you have format information in addition to that specified in the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure, you can add it immediately after this structure. If you do this, update the <B>biSize</B> member to specify the number of bytes used by the structure and your additional information. If a color table is part of the BITMAPINFO information, it follows immediately after your additional information. Return ICERR_OK when your driver has finished updating the data format. </P>

<P>If your driver gets ICM_DECOMPRESS_QUERY, <I>dwParam1</I> points to a BITMAPINFO data structure containing the input format data. The <I>dwParam2</I> parameter will either be NULL or contain a pointer to a BITMAPINFO structure describing the decompressed format the client-application wants to use. </P>

<P>If <I>dwParam2</I> is NULL, your decompression driver can use any output format. In this case, the client-application wants to know if you can decompress the input format and it doesn't care about the output format. If <I>dwParam2</I> points to a BITMAPINFO structure, the suggested format will be the native or best format for the decompressed data. For example, if playback is on an 8-bit device, the client-application will suggest an 8-bit DIB. </P>

<P>If your driver supports the specified input and output format (which might also include stretching the image), or it supports the specified input with NULL specified for <I>dwParam2</I>, return ICERR_OK to indicate the driver accepts the formats. </P>

<P>Your driver does not have to accept the formats suggested. If you fail the message by returning ICERR_BADFORMAT, the client-application will suggest alternate formats until your driver accepts one. If your driver exhausts the list of formats normally used, the client-application requests a format with ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT. </P>

<P>If you are decompressing to 8-bit data, your driver will also receive the ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_PALETTE message. Your driver should add a color table to the BITMAPINFO data structure and specify the number of palette entries in the <B>biClrUsed</B> member. The space reserved for the color table will always be 256 colors. </P>
