<P>Any driver that has a device object and wants to be a WMI data provider must register its device object with WMI. After the device has been initialized enough to handle receiving WMI IRPs, the driver should call <B>IoWMIRegistrationControl</B>, passing the device object and setting <I>Action</I> to WMIREG_ACTION_REGISTER.</P>

<P>When the device no longer wishes to be a WMI data provider, possibly at the point a device realizes that it is going away, the driver should call <B>IoWMIRegistrationControl </B>with <I>Action</I> set to WMIREG_ACTION_DEREGISTER. </P>

<P>If a device changes radically and wants to completely reregister the set of GUIDs that it supports, it should call <B>IoWMIRegistrationControl</B> with <I>Action</I> set to WMIREG_ACTION_REREGISTER. </P>

<P>If the device wants to change the static instance names of the GUIDs already supported or to add or remove support for GUIDs, it should call <B>IoWMIRegistrationControl </B>with <I>Action</I> set to WMIREG_ACTION_UPDATE_GUID. </P>
