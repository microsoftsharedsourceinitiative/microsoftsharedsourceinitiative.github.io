<P>Enumerators locate and identify Plug and Play devices and retrieve information about these devices to use to construct the hardware tree. The Configuration Manager provides services for registering enumerators as well as services enumerators can use to carry out their enumeration tasks. In particular, an enumerator can register an enumeration handler function by using the <B>CONFIGMG_Register_Enumerator</B> service. The Configuration Manager sends an enumeration message to this handler whenever it needs the enumerator to carry out a task. </P>

<P>There are these enumeration services. </P>

<P>The enumeration handler must return CR_DEFAULT for any messages it does not not process. </P>

<P>Enumerators are responsible for creating device identifiers for the devices they locate. Each identifier must be unique and be consistently the same on each system boot. The string must be constructed so that it can serve to identify a unique entry in the registry. The string must start with the enumerator's name followed by a backslash. For example, the ISA Plug and Play enumerator starts all device identifiers with "ISAPNP\". </P>
