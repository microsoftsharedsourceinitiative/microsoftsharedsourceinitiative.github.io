<P>Each time before you run the UniTool application, you must make sure the LIB and INCLUDE environment variables contain the values you need to run UniTool. You do this by clicking the Start button, selecting the Run option, and then entering the command </P>

<PRE>%DDKROOT%\DDKENV 16 PRINTER
 </PRE>

<P>where %DDKROOT% is the full path to the DDK root directory. </P>

<P>After you run the DDKENV batch file to establish the environment for creating 16-bit printer drivers, you can start the UniTool application by clicking the Windows 95 Start button and then selecting the Programs option, followed by the Windows 95 DDK option, followed by the Unitool option. </P>

<P>(You can also start UniTool by clicking the Start button, selecting the Run option, and entering the command </P>

<PRE>%DDKROOT%\PRINTER\BIN\UNITOOL
 </PRE>

<P>or using the Browse button to find UniTool.) </P>

<P>Once you have started UniTool, from the File menu, choose the New command. After you choose the New command, the Type of New File dialog box appears in the main window. Choose the MiniDriver button. </P>

<P>UniTool then displays a dialog box that prompts you for the name of your minidriver, the name of the directory in which it will be stored, and the name of the source minidriver. The Source Minidriver list box contains the names of several types of minidrivers. The selection you make depends on the type of printer for which you are developing a minidriver. If the printer's resolution and command set are compatible with that of a 9- or 24-pin Epson or IBM printer, choose the corresponding entry from the list box. Similarly, if the printer supports Hewlett Packard printers that use PCL, choose "HP PCL4 Minidriver" or "HP PCL5 Minidriver." However, if the printer's resolution or command set is unique and differs significantly from the available choices, choose "Generic Minidriver." </P>

<P>Once you have created your new minidriver directory and installed the appropriate files, you can begin initializing your minidriver's data table. If you've selected the Generic Minidriver as your starting point, or if your printer does not support the same resolutions as one of the compatible minidrivers, it will be necessary to specify master units. If, on the other hand, your printer uses the same resolutions as one of the source minidrivers, you can immediately begin specifying control information. For information on specifying master units and on specifying control information, see the UNITOOL.HLP help file. </P>
