<P>Windows 95 expands on the MS-DOS 6.0 ability to allow multiple-configuration boots. Windows 95 allows Windows applications and drivers to be configuration-aware. By examining a DockSerialID returned by a Plug and Play BIOS, the system will attempt to automatically determine the appropriate state to boot the system in. If the appropriate state can not be determined, the user will be prompted to select the correct state from several configurations with the same DockSerialID. If a new DockSerialID is generated that the user has not had before (for example, if the user plugs into a new docking station in a friend's office), the user is asked to run full-scale hardware detection and associate a friendly name (for example, "Docked in Jane's office,") with the new DockSerialID. </P>
