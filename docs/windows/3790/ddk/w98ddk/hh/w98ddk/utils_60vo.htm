<UL>
	<LI>Make sure you are using the WDEB386 contained in the Windows 95 DDK (build 950). You need this version to work with the retail version of Windows 95. </LI>

	<LI>Run Direct Cable Connection (DCC) to make sure your null-modem cable works. DCC is optionally installed with Windows 95. To see if it is installed, click the Start button, point to Accessories, and then look for Direct Cable Connection in the menu. If it is not there, use the Add/Remove Programs Control Panel to install it. </LI>

	<LI>Make sure handshaking is disabled on your computer.</LI>

	<LI>If the debugger stops responding partway through boot, this could be because you have a <CODE>debugcom</CODE> or <CODE>debugbaud</CODE> line in your <CODE>system.ini</CODE> file.  These entries override the values provided on the wdeb386 command line.</LI>

	<LI>If the debugger is dropping characters or if you see garbage characters when doing large output, type<CODE> y crdelay=8000 </CODE>to slow down the delay between lines.  The value of crdelay is a hex value from 0000 to FFFF.  You may have to experiment with the crdelay value.</LI>

	<LI>If you are running out of memory with the debugger, use the command line option /L, which will have the effect of shrinking symbol files by a factor of three.</LI>

	<LI>Each symbol file uses an XMS handle.  If you run out of handles, edit CONFIG.SYS to contain<BR>
device=himem.sys /NUMHANDLES=32.</LI>
