<P>GDI begins with a handle to a device context (hDC) to try to find a matching ICC color profile. GDI opens the ICM\prtr key in the registry (for a discussion of the registry, see a later section) to enumerate all of the printer manufacturers that have currently installed profiles. GDI must next obtain the four-byte manufacturer identifier and four-byte model identifier from the printer driver by using one of the two methods listed below. Windows 95 device driver developers are encouraged to support the new DeviceCapabilities indices used by the second method given below. </P>
