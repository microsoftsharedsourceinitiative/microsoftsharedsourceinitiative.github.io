<P>The virtual device must <I>not</I> call the <B>Simulate_Int</B> or <B>Exec_Int</B> service, but the virtual device may modify the system virtual machine memory to restore the system state to allow Windows to exit without complication. </P>

<P>The system restores the instance snapshot before sending this message. </P>

<P>The virtual device may not access pageable data during the processing of the <B>System_Exit</B> message because the swap file may be in a bad state (which is why the system is crashing in the first place), or the swap file may already have been closed. Virtual devices that wish to access pageable data during System_Exit must lock the data during <B>Sys_VM_Terminate</B>. During a system crash, the <B>Sys_VM_Terminate</B> message is not sent, so the virtual device should have some way of determining during <B>System_Exit</B> whether or not it was able to lock its data; if not, it should skip any procedures which use the pageable data. </P>
