<P>With LFN support, file names can be up to 255 characters long (excluding the NULL character). The period (.) is a valid file name character and can be used as many times as desired. The following special characters can also be used in LFNs. </P>

<P>: + , ; = [ ] </P>

<P>Blank spaces can be used anywhere in an LFN, but blank spaces and periods at the end of a file name are ignored. There is no requirement that LFN file names have extensions; however, many applications still create and use them. </P>

<P>An LFN can be all uppercase, all lowercase, or mixed case. The case is preserved for directory listings but is ignored in file searches and all other system operations. Therefore, in a given directory, there cannot be more than one file with the same name when the only difference is case. </P>
