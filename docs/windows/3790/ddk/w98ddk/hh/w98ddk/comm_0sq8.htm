<P>Before performing any other operations on a communications resource, a client VxD must call the <B>_VCOMM_OpenComm</B> service to open the resource. This service initializes the communications device and the port driver associated with it, and returns a communications handle that is used in subsequent calls to VCOMM client VxD services. </P>

<P>The <B>_VCOMM_CloseComm</B> service closes a communications resource. If the transmit queue is not empty, the <I>close property</I> of the port determines whether the remaining data is sent before the port is closed: if it is PORTCLOSE_WAIT, the service does not close the port and does not return until the characters in the transmit queue have been sent; if it is PORTCLOSE_FLUSH, the service discards the data in the transmit queue and closes the port immediately. You can query and set the close property using the <B>_VCOMM_EscapeCommFunction</B> service. </P>

<P>Client VxDs must close any communications resources they open. A VxD that opens a communications resource for use in a virtual machine (VM) must process the <B>VM_Not_Executeable</B> event so that it can close the resource if the VM terminates. </P>
