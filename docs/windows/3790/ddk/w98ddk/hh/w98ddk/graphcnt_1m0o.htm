<P>The <B>FONTINFO</B> structure contains optional members (<B>dfFlags</B> through <B>dfReserved1</B>) that are present only if the font has been designed for Windows versions 3.<I>x</I>. If GDI realizes a font for a driver, the font's corresponding <B>FONTINFO</B> structure will not include these optional members unless the RC_BIGFONT bit is set in the <B>dpRaster</B> member of the driver's <B>GDIINFO</B> structure.

</DD>

<DT><B>dfPixWidth</B> </DT>

<DD>Width of all characters in the font. 

<P>For vector fonts, the <B>dfPixWidth</B> member is the width of the grid on which the font was digitized. 


<P>For raster fonts, <B>dfPixWidth</B> is the width, in pixels, of each character bitmap. If that member is zero, the font has variable-width characters and these widths are specified in the character-width table immediately following this structure. 
</DD>

<DT><B>dfPixHeight</B> </DT>

<DD>Height of all characters in the font. 

<P>For vector fonts, the <B>dfPixHeight</B> member is the height of the grid on which the font was digitized.

</DD>

<DT><B>dfPitchAndFamily</B> </DT>

<DD>Pitch and font family. The pitch specifies whether the characters in the font have the same width or variable widths. The font family indicates, in a general way, the look of a font. 

<P>The <B>dfPitchAndFamily</B> member can be a combination of these values: 


<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>0x01 </TD>

<P>If the high-order 4 bits are set to FF_DONTCARE (0x00), the font does not belong to a specific family. 
</DD>

<DT><B>dfAvgWidth</B> </DT>

<DD>Width of characters in the font. For fixed-pitch fonts, this value is the same as <B>dfPixWidth</B>. For variable-pitched fonts, this is the width of the uppercase character "X." </DD>

<DT><B>dfMaxWidth</B> </DT>

<DD>Maximum pixel-width of any character in the font. For fixed-pitch fonts, this is simply <B>dfPixWidth</B>. </DD>

<DT><B>dfFirstChar</B> </DT>

<DD>First-character code defined by this font. Character definitions are stored only for the characters actually present in a font, so this member should be used when calculating indices into the character-width table following this structure. </DD>

<DT><B>dfLastChar</B> </DT>

<DD>Last-character code defined by this font. Note that all the characters with codes between the <B>dfFirstChar</B> and <B>dfLastChar</B> member must be present in the character-width table. </DD>

<DT><B>dfDefaultChar</B> </DT>

<DD>Default character. A device driver uses this character as a substitute for any character in a string that is out of the range of the <B>dfFirstChar</B> through <B>dfLastChar</B> members. The character is given relative to <B>dfFirstChar</B> so that the actual value of the default character is the sum of <B>dfDefaultChar</B> and <B>dfFirstChar</B>. Ideally, the <B>dfDefaultChar</B> member should be a visible character in the current font--for example, a period (.). </DD>

<DT><B>dfBreakChar</B> </DT>

<DD>Word-break character. Applications use this character to separate words when wrapping or justifying lines of text. The character is given relative to <B>dfFirstChar</B> so that the actual value of the word-break character is the sum of the <B>dfBreakChar</B> and <B>dfFirstChar</B> members. In many fonts, <B>dfBreakChar</B> is zero and <B>dfFirstChar</B> is 32. This means that the word-break character value is 32, an ASCII space. </DD>

<DT><B>dfWidthBytes</B> </DT>

<DD>Number of bytes in each row of the font bitmap (raster fonts). This field is not used for vector fonts. The <B>dfWidthBytes</B> member is always an even quantity so that rows of the bitmap start on 16-bit boundaries. </DD>

<DT><B>dfDevice</B> </DT>

<DD>Offset from the beginning of the segment that contains the <B>FONTINFO</B> structure to the null-terminated ASCII string that specifies the device name. For a generic font, this value is NULL. </DD>

<DT><B>dfFace</B> </DT>

<DD>Offset from the beginning of the segment that contains the <B>FONTINFO</B> structure to the null-terminated ASCII string that specifies the name of the font face. </DD>

<DT><B>dfBitsPointer</B> </DT>

<DD>Absolute machine address of the bitmap. This member is set by GDI. The <B>dfBitsPointer</B> member is guaranteed to be even. </DD>

<DT><B>dfBitsOffset</B> </DT>

<DD>Offset from the beginning of the segment that contains the <B>FONTINFO</B> structure to the beginning of the bitmap information. 

<P>If the PF_BITS_IS_ADDRESS bit is set in <B>dfType</B>, <B>dfBitsOffset</B> is an absolute address of the bitmap or vector information. For example, this bit is set if the font bitmap or vector information is in ROM. 


<P>For raster fonts, <B>dfBitsOffset</B> points to a sequence of bytes that make up the bitmaps for each character in the font. 


<P>For vector fonts, <B>dfBitsOffset</B> points to a string of bytes or words (depending on the size of the grid on which the font was digitized) that specifies the strokes for each character of the font. The <B>dfBitsOffset</B> member must be even. 
</DD>

<DT><B>dfReserved</B> </DT>

<DD>Reserved; do not use. This member is present only for raster fonts. In Windows 2.<I>x</I> fonts, this member ensures that the character-width table (which immediately follows this member) starts on a 16-bit boundary. </DD>

<DT><B>dfFlags</B> </DT>

<DD>Format of the font bitmap information. Can be one of these values:

<P>All device drivers must support Windows 2.<I>x</I> fonts. If a device driver supports Windows 3.<I>x</I> fonts, it must set the RC_BIGFONT bit in the <B>dpRaster</B> member of its <B>GDIINFO</B> structure. Printer drivers can call the <B>GetDeviceCaps</B> function (GDI.80), and check for the RC_BIGFONT bit in the raster capabilities to determine whether the display driver uses Windows 3.<I>x</I> fonts. </P>

<P>When a device driver realizes a font by using the <B>RealizeObject</B> function, the <B>dfFace</B> and <B>dfDevice</B> members must point to valid character strings that contains the font and device names. Windows 2.x Fonts </P>

<P>For Windows 2.<I>x</I> fonts, the character-width table is either an array of integer values or an array of glyph-entry structures. The number of elements in the array is equal to: </P>

<PRE>dfLastChar - dfFirstChar + 2
 </PRE>

<P>That is, there is always one more element than the number of characters in the font. The extra entry is available for storing the size, in bytes, of the last character in a vector font. Although this extra entry applies only to vector fonts, it is present for all fonts. </P>

<P>For fixed-pitch vector fonts, the character-width table is an array of integer values. In this case, each element of the array is an offset (relative to the start of the segment that contains the <B>FONTINFO</B> structure) to the first byte or 16 bits of vector information for the given character. The number of bytes or words for a particular character is calculated by subtracting its character-width table entry from the entry for the next character. </P>

<P>For variable-pitch vector fonts, the character width table is an array of <B>VECTORGLYPHENTRY</B> structures. The <B>VECTORGLYPHENTRY</B> structure has the following form: </P>

<PRE>typedef struct tagVECTORGLYPHENTRY {

<P>The <B>vgeOffset</B> member specifies the offset (relative to the start of the segment that contains the <B>FONTINFO</B> structure) to the first byte or 16 bits of vector information for the given character. The <B>vgeWidth</B> member specifies the width for the character. </P>

<P>For raster fonts, the character-width table is an array of <B>RASTERGLYPHENTRY</B> structures. </P>

<P>The <B>rgeWidth</B> member specifies the width, in pixels, of the bitmap for the given character. The member also specifies the advance width for the given character. The <B>rgeOffset</B> member specifies the offset (relative to the start of the segment that contains the <B>FONTINFO</B> structure) to the first byte of bitmap information for the character. </P>

<P>Windows 2.<I>x</I> fonts cannot exceed 64K. Windows 3.x Fonts </P>

<P>Windows 3.<I>x</I> fonts are primarily designed for use on systems with sufficient memory and a microprocessor (such as an 80386) that has instructions using 32-bit address offsets. </P>
