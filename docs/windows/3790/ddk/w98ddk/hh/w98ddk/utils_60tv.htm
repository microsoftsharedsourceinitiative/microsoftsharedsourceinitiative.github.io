<P>You need a computer with a serial port, and you'll need to buy or make a null-modem cable. You only need a three-line null modem cable (transmit, receive, and ground). You don't need one with handshaking lines because WDEB386 doesn't use handshaking. You should also disable handshaking on your computer (Handshaking allows slower receivers to keep up with the amount of data being transmitted by telling the transmitter to stop sending data until it has a chance to catch up). </P>
