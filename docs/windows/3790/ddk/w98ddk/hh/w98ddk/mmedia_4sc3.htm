<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>MCI_WAVE_OPEN_BUFFER </TD>

</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>Note that <I>lParam2</I> specifies a far pointer to the <B>MCI_WAVE_OPEN_PARMS</B> structure. (Devices with extended command sets might replace this structure with a device-specific structure.) </P>

<P>If MCI_OPEN_SHAREABLE is not specified when a device or device element is initially opened, then all subsequent <B>MCI_OPEN</B> messages to the device or device element will fail. If the device or device element is already open, and this flag is not specified, the call will fail even if the first open command specified MCI_OPEN_SHAREABLE. Files for the MCISEQ and MCIWAVE devices are nonshareable. </P>

<P>Case is ignored in the device name, but there must not be any leading or trailing blanks. </P>

<P>To use automatic type selection (via the [mci extensions] section of the WIN.INI file), assign the file name (including file extension) to the <B>lpstrElementName</B> member, assign a NULL pointer to the <B>lpstrDeviceType</B> member, and set the MCI_OPEN_ELEMENT flag. </P>
