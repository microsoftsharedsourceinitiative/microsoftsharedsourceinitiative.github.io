<P>When the policy owner decides to put a device in a low power state, the following actions occur:</P>

<P>The policy owner calls the configuration manager service <A HREF="vxd-pm_3a79.htm"><B>Set_DevNode_PowerState</B></A> on the target device and tells it to go into one of the following low power states:</P>

<P class=indent1>CM_POWERSTATE_D1<BR>
CM_POWERSTATE_D2<BR>
CM_POWERSTATE_D3</P>

<P>If any child devices are in a higher power state than the target's power state, the configuration manager sends those devices a message CONFIG_SET_POWERSTATE_D<I>x</I>, where <I>x</I> indicates the target device's power state. . </P>

<P>In response to the <B>Set_DevNode_PowerState </B>call, the configuration manager sends a CONFIG_SET_POWERSTATE_D<I>x</I><B> </B>message to the driver (where <I>x</I> = the power state to go into).</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The configuration manager never sends CONFIG_SET_POWERSTATE_D<I>x</I> for a power state that is not supported, according to the device's current capabilities mask. Instead, the configuration manager calls the driver with the next highest power state supported in the capabilities mask.</P>

<P>The device driver saves any hardware context that it needs to later restore the device to D0. If any proprietary commands are required to put the device in the low power state and these commands are not offered by bus standards, the device driver can send the proprietary commands at this time.</P>

<P>The configuration manager sends a CONFIG_SET_POWERSTATE_D<I>x</I> message for the target device to the device's parent drivers (in sequence from the device toward the root) to allow the parent drivers to signal hardware to go into the target low power state.</P>

<P>In summary, the policy holder calls <B>Set_DevNode_PowerState</B> to set the device's power state. The driver handles CONFIG_SET_POWERSTATE_D<I>x</I><B> </B>messages<B> </B>and saves device context.</P>
