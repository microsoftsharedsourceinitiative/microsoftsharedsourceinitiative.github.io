<P>The Multimedia option in Control Panel is the preferred method for installing device drivers. The Multimedia option uses information in the OEMSETUP.INF file for your driver to add the entries in the [drivers] section, as well as entries in the [386enh] section, to install any VxDs you require. </P>

<P>The entry that identifies your driver in the [drivers] section lets Windows load the driver. If this entry is absent, your driver won't be recognized. While installation programs usually add the necessary entry for completed device drivers, you might have to manually add it while you are developing your device driver. You might also have to manually add any [386enh] entries you need. The final version of your device driver should use an installation program to create and delete the entries in these two sections. The following table identifies the keynames for various multimedia drivers. </P>

<P>If there is more than one wave or MIDI driver, append a number from 1 to 9 after the keyname. When you have multiple drivers, use sequential numbers to identify them. </P>

<P>For example, the following [drivers] section extract identifies one waveform device driver named SNDBLST2.DRV, two MIDI device drivers named ADLIB.DRV and MPU401.DRV, and one video-capture device driver named BRAVADO.DRV. </P>
