<P>A virtual device uses the synchronization services to coordinate the execution of threads and virtual machines. The following terms are related to synchronization: </P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=22%>Term </TH>
<TH align=left width=78%>Definition </TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>block ID </TD>
<TD width=78%>A programmer-defined 32-bit value associated with one or more blocked threads. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>claim </TD>
<TD width=78%>A request on the part of a virtual device to enter a critical section. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>claim count </TD>
<TD width=78%>A system-defined variable that indicates the number of times the owner of a critical section has claimed the section. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>context switch </TD>
<TD width=78%>The act of turning the CPU's "attention" from one thread to another. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>critical section </TD>
<TD width=78%>A block of program code that accesses a shared system resource. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>critical section owner </TD>
<TD width=78%>The thread or virtual machine that is currently executing in a critical section. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>must-complete count </TD>
<TD width=78%>A system-defined variable that indicates the number of times the owner of a must-complete section has claimed the section. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>must-complete section </TD>
<TD width=78%>A block of code that must be executed in its entirety before any other thread or virtual machine can run. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>mutex </TD>
<TD width=78%>A synchronization object that ensures only one thread at a time can access a shared resource. A thread must have ownership of the mutex before it can access the resource. The thread blocks if the mutex is owned by another thread. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>reentry count </TD>
<TD width=78%>A system-defined variable that indicates the number of times the owner of a mutex has called the _<B>EnterMutex</B> service after gaining ownership. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>semaphore </TD>
<TD width=78%>An synchronization object that maintains a token count between zero and some maximum value. The object's state is signaled when its token count is greater than zero, and not-signaled when its count is zero. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>signal </TD>
<TD width=78%>To increase the token count of a semaphore. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>semaphore token count </TD>
<TD width=78%>The value associated with a semaphore. The initial token count is set when the semaphore is created. A signal operation increments the token count, and a wait operation decrements it. </TD>
</TR>
