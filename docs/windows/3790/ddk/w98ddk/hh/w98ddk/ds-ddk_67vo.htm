<P>A property set is a collection of related properties. The notion of property sets is pervasive throughout the new WDM audio port/miniport driver model and the new Kernel Streaming architecture. DirectSound3D uses property sets as well to communicate with the driver for 3-D virtualization. </P>

<P>When dealing with properties, a globally unique identifier (GUID) identifies a set of properties, and a <B>ULONG</B> identifies a particular property within the set. </P>

<P>In addition to the property set identifier (the GUID) and the property identifier (the <B>ULONG</B>), additional parameters can be associated with the property. These parameters are separate from the actual values of the properties. Clients typically use these parameters to further specify a particular instance of the property on the object. The property set interface specifications for <B>IDsDriverPropertySet</B> and <B>IKsPropertySet</B> intentionally leave these parameters undefined. This allows the designer of the property set to use them in a way most beneficial to the properties within the set being designed. So, the precise meaning of these parameters is defined with the definition of the properties and should be provided by the vendor whose driver implements the property set. </P>
