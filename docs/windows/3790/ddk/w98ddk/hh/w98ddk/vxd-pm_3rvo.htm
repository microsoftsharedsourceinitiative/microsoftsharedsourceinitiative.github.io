<P>The configuration manager sends the CONFIG_APM_RESUME_CRITICAL and CONFIG_APM_RESUME_SUSPEND messages to inform device drivers and bus drivers that the system has awakened.</P>

<P>The CONFIG_APM_RESUME_SUSPEND message is sent when the system is waking normally. CONFIG_APM _RESUME_CRITICAL is sent when the system is waking after an emergency sleep in which the drivers were not told the system was sleeping (for example, due to power failure).</P>

<P>Device drivers should do nothing and wait until the device needs to be turned on according to its power policy. </P>

<P>Bus drivers should put their buses in a power state that is high enough to detect device insertions and removals. This may require turning on the bus (with <A HREF="vxd-pm_3a79.htm"><B>Set_DevNode_PowerState</B></A>) and doing a re-enumeration.</P>
