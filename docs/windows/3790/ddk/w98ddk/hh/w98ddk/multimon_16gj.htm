<P>The following two problems may prevent motherboard graphics devices from  supporting multimonitor capabilities:

<UL>
	<LI><B>PCI motherboard graphics adapter is hidden from the enumerator</B>. 
<P>Some system vendors hide the motherboard graphics adapter from the PCI bus when another graphics adapter is detected in the system. Microsoft strongly recommends that the OEM enumerate the motherboard device as a disabled PCI device rather than hiding it.
</LI>

	<LI><B>Operating system cannot read the ROM from a motherboard graphics adapter</B>.
<P>The ROM for the motherboard adapter should be accessible through the PCI ROM BAR, just as any other PCI device.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>As an additional design recommendation, the OEM should provide an option in the system BIOS setup utility to force the motherboard graphics device to be used (that is, to ignore and leave disabled any nonmotherboard PCI graphics adapters). This option  ensures that a user with a PCI hot-docking system will always be able to undock, because the VGA device will be in the mobile unit.</P>
