<P>End-users can install the IR communications device driver on their Windows 95 computer and run applications using wireless infrared communications instead of serial or parallel cables. The driver has been successfully tested on the following Windows 95 notebook computers, which have built-in IR ports: 

<UL>
	<LI>Digital® HiNote Ultra CT475 </LI>

	<LI>Gateway® 2000 Liberty </LI>

	<LI>Gateway Solo </LI>

	<LI>HP® Omnibook™ 600CT </LI>

	<LI>HP Omnibook 4000C </LI>

	<LI>IBM® ThinkPad® 701C (Butterfly) </LI>

	<LI>IBM ThinkPad 755 (most configurations) </LI>

	<LI>Midwest Micro Elite </LI>

	<LI>Midwest Micro Elite p90 </LI>

	<LI>Sharp® PC 3050 </LI>

	<LI>TI® TravelMate(tm) 5000 </LI>

	<LI>Toshiba® Satellite Pro 400 CDT </LI>
</UL>

<P>In addition, the driver has been successfully tested on Windows 95 platforms with the following IR adapters connected to serial ports: 

<UL>
	<LI>ACTiSYS ACT-200L Infrared Wireless Interface </LI>

	<LI>ACTiSYS ACT-220L Infrared Wireless Interface </LI>

	<LI>Adaptec™ AIRport APA-9320 External Infrared Adapter (this adapter is also called the Adaptec AIRport 2000) </LI>

	<LI>Adaptec AIRport 1000 </LI>

	<LI>AMP PhasIR Serial Adapter </LI>

	<LI>Extended Systems JetEye PC Infrared PC Interface (ESI-9680) </LI>

	<LI>Parallax IR Adapter LiteLink PRA9500A </LI>
</UL>

<P>To obtain any of the IR adapters previously listed, contact the adapter manufacturer. The addresses of these manufacturers are listed in <I>IR Adapter Manufacturer Names and Addresses</I>. </P>

<P>The following applications have been run successfully over an IR communications link, using the IR communications driver and the hardware previously listed: 

<UL>
	<LI>Windows 95 Direct Cable Connection (DCC). </LI>

	<LI>Various Windows communications applications, including HyperTerminal, DynaComm, and Carbon Copy. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Because the IR link is simulating a serial communications link, some communications applications may not perform as expected after they connect over the IR link. For more information, see <I>Troubleshooting</I>. </P>

<P>For instructions on running DCC over an IR link, see <I>Notes on Running the Direct Cable Connection Application Over an IR Link</I>. </P>

<P>Numerous Windows 95 applications have successfully printed over an IR link to an HP(r) Laserjet(r) 5P or 5MP printer, which have built-in IR ports. </P>
