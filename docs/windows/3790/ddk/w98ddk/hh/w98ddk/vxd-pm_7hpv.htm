<P>From the device driver's perspective, the operating system wakes the machine in one pass, as follows:

<UL>
	<LI>The configuration manager calls each driver (in sequence from the root to children) with CONFIG_APM_RESUME_SUSPEND or CONFIG_APM _RESUME_CRITICAL.</LI>

	<LI>CONFIG_APM_RESUME_CRITICAL is sent when the system is waking from an emergency sleep (one in which the drivers were not told the system was sleeping). A power failure is one possible cause of an emergency sleep.</LI>

	<LI>CONFIG_APM_RESUME_SUSPEND is sent when the system is waking normally.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Upon receiving one of these messages, the driver may turn on the device.<B> </B>The driver should wait until the device needs to be turned on according to its power policy. </P>

<P>Bus drivers put their buses in a power state that is high enough to detect device insertions and removals. Bus drivers do not automatically perform re-enumeration at this time. If re-enumeration is required, the configuration manager sends a CONFIG_ENUMERATE message.</P>

<P>In summary, device drivers must listen for CONFIG_APM_RESUME_SUSPEND and CONFIG_APM _RESUME_CRITICAL and turn on their devices as needed. </P>
