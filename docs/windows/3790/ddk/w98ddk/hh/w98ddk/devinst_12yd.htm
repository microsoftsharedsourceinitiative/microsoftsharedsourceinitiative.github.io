<P>Device information (INF) files contribute to the goal of providing customers and developers with an easier way to install hardware devices. The information in an INF file brings together one or more devices, device drivers, and the operating system's installation procedure to ensure an easy and complete hardware setup and installation. </P>

<P>If you are providing hardware or plug hardware for Windows 95 computers, you must create an INF file that enables your device to be installed and to work in the Windows 95 environment. The Windows 95 DDK contains a tool, Infedit, that enables you to build an INF file by responding to the Infedit user interface. The topic <I>Getting Started Using Infedit</I> contains the requirements for a sample INF file, XSCSI.INF, and walks through the process of using Infedit to turn those requirements into a working INF file. </P>

<P>For more information about how Windows 95 uses INF files, use the Programs command from the Windows 95 Start menu to open the Windows 95 DDK and then select the Plug and Play Reference. Use the Find tab on the displayed property sheet to find instances of the word INF in the Plug and Play topics. </P>
