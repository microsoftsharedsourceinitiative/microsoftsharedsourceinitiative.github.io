<TD width=55%>To manage the device drivers, the IOS creates a chain of <B>DVT</B> structures that contain information about the device driver, such as its file name and the address of its asynchronous event routine. The IOS adds a new <B>DVT</B> structure whenever a new driver or client first registers with the IOS. The IOS places the address of the <B>DVT</B> structure for a driver in the <B>ILB</B> structure, however, drivers should avoid modifying the <B>DVT</B>. </TD>
