<P>Interrupt-level and port assignments, and any other hardware-related settings, can be stored in a section with the same name as the driver in the user's SYSTEM.INI file. (Alternatively, your driver might use its own .INI file for this information.) </P>

<P>For example, the following SYSTEM.INI section, created by the Bravado driver, specifies interrupt level 9 and memory base E: </P>

<PRE>[Bravado.drv]
Interrupt=9
MemoryBase=E
 </PRE>

<P>To conform to other Windows drivers, use the keynames <B>int</B> and <B>port</B> to specify interrupt-level and port assignments. For example, the following SYSTEM.INI section specifies interrupt level 3 and port 0x220 for the Sound Blaster(tm) driver: </P>

<PRE>[Sound Blaster]
int=3
port=220
</PRE>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Software-only codecs do not require interrupt and port settings, but hardware-assisted codecs do. Interrupt and port settings for hardware-assisted codecs are similar to those used by wave and capture drivers. The ACM is like software-only codecs in that it does not require specific interrupt and port settings. The installation program for any audio hardware in a system should create the appropriate entries for that hardware. </P>
