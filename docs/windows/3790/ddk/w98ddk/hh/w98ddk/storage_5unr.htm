<P>The Win32 named pipe APIs require special support from the FSDs. The named pipe functions are provided in addition to the FSD File I/O Interface. Only client named pipe functions are supported under Chicago at this time and these are defined here. </P>

<P>The client named pipe functions will be supported by the local named pipe file system and may optionally be supported by network redirectors. A local disk file system will not provide these functions. Some of these functions are used by both client and server applications. </P>

<P>Each client named pipe routine and its I/O request parameters are given in the following. These routines follow the same calling convention of the FSD file I/O routines defined above. All of the FSD routines receive the ID of the requesting process in the ir_pid field and return success or failure info in the ir_error field. </P>
