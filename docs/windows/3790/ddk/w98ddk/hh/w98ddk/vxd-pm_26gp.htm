<P>The power policy for most buses is the same: the bus will be in the same power state as the highest power state of its children. For example, if all the devices on a bus are in either D2 or D3, the bus can be put in D2. </P>

<P class=proch><B><IMG SRC="../images/wedge.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Because most buses can be handled in the same manner, the configuration manager automatically handles this policy as follows</B>

<OL>
	<LI>After putting a device in a low power state, the configuration manager automatically puts the bus in a power state that matches the highest of the power states set for the devices on that bus.</LI>

	<LI>Before turning on a device, the configuration manager automatically turns on the bus that the device is attached to, if not already on.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Note that this policy does not work for all buses. For example, the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) bus<B> </B>should not be turned off when its devices have all reached the D3 state. Doing so would prevent the hardware from detecting new devices that have been added.  </P>
