<P>Device drivers must be written to control a specific device. For this reason, samples that illustrate device-specific commands and functions are not practical in the DDK. However, the kit does illustrate how to communicate with the standardized Windows installable-driver interface, in such samples as IMAADPCM. </P>

<P>The IMAADPCM.C file contains routines that encode and decode according to the IMA-ADPCM format. This is the same format used in Intel's DVI standard. The IMA has endorsed this format as a standard for audio compression, and Intel has released it as public-domain software. The files for this sample are in the IMAADPCM directory. </P>
