<TD width=73%>The execution of a virtual machine to the exclusion of all other non-system virtual machines. When a virtual machine has the execution focus and is executing exclusively, the VMM suspends all other non-system virtual machines. The VMM never suspends the system virtual machine. </TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>initial thread </TD>
<TD width=73%>The first thread created in a virtual machine. The system virtual machine can have many thread, non-system virtual machines have only one thread. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>inversion boost </TD>
<TD width=73%>An increase in the time-slice priority of a thread that owns a resource so that the priority matches that of the highest-priority thread that blocks on the resource. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>inversion priority </TD>
<TD width=73%>In priority inversion prevention, the time-slice priority to which the owner thread is raised. Also see priority inversion prevention. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>normal priority class </TD>
<TD width=73%>A group of time-slice priority values associated with threads that are not idle, high priority, or real time. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>priority class </TD>
<TD width=73%>A group of priority values associated with threads of a particular type. Also see idle priority class, normal priority class, high priority class, and real-time priority class. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>priority inversion list </TD>
<TD width=73%>A list, maintained internally by the VMM, that contains information used to raise the priority of threads that own resources on which other threads block. Also see priority inversion prevention. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>priority inversion prevention </TD>
<TD width=73%>A technique the VMM uses to prevent a form of deadlock in which a low priority thread that owns a resource is unable to run because of its low priority, and a higher priority thread that also needs the resource remains blocked while waiting for the resource to be freed. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>real-time priority class </TD>
<TD width=73%>A group of priority values associated with threads that perform time-critical tasks. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>round robin </TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>thread </TD>
<TD width=73%>The basic entity to which the VMM allocates processor time. A thread can execute any part of the application's code, including a part currently being executed by another thread. All threads of a process share the virtual address space, global variables, and operating system resources of the process. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>thread group </TD>
<TD width=73%>Two or more threads whose priorities are boosted at the same time. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>thread starvation </TD>
<TD width=73%>A situation in which a thread does not receive adequate processor time because its time-slice priority is too low. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
