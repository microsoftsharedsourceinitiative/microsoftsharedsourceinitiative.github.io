<P>Instances the installed MS-DOS character device driver. This service is only valid during the <B>Init_Complete</B> message. Uses Flags. 

<UL>
	<LI>Clears the carry flag if the device is instanced; otherwise, sets the carry flag to indicate one of the following errors: 
<UL>
	<LI>No device with this name in device list </LI>

	<LI>Device is in MS-DOS RAM BIOS (Segment of device == 70h) </LI>

	<LI>User overrides with the global setting in SYSTEM.INI </LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>

<DL>
<DT><I>Device_Name</I> </DT>

<DD>Address of the 8-character device name. This name must exactly match the name as it found in the device header in low memory. Characters must be in uppercase; case conversion is not performed. Names shorter than 8 characters must be padded with spaces. The colon (:) must not be used. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>This service applies only to installed character devices (where the device segment is not equal to 70h). It cannot instance devices that are in the MS-DOS RAM BIOS because there is no way to determine their start and end addresses. It is the job of MS-DOS instancing to correctly instance things related to character devices in the MS-DOS RAM BIOS. </P>

<P>This service instances the entire device. It cannot differentiate code and data. </P>

<P>This service is available only during the <B>Init_Complete</B> message. The service is in the ICODE segment so it becomes invalid after the <B>Init_Complete</B> message. Calls to the <B>_AddInstanceItem</B> service are also invalid after <B>Init_Complete</B>. </P>

<P>Do not use this service to instance devices added with the service <B>DOSMGR_Add_Device</B>. To instance an added device, a virtual device must call the <B>_AddInstanceItem</B> service or use the GVDAInstance flag in the <B>_Allocate_Global_V86_Data_Area</B> service. </P>
