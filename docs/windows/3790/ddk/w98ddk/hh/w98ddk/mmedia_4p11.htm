<P>If the driver's output queue is not empty, it should stop and mark all pending data blocks as done by setting the MHDR_DONE bit in the <B>dwFlags</B> field of the <B>MIDIHDR</B> structure for each block. The driver should then notify the client by using <B>DriverCallback</B> to send a <B>MOM_DONE</B> message for each data block. </P>

<P>If the device is an output port, the driver should send a MIDI note-off event for all 128 notes on all 16 channels. Optionally, the driver can keep track of which notes are turned on and send note-off events only for those notes. In addition, the driver should send a damper pedal off event (controller 0x40) for each channel. If the device is an internal synthesizer, the driver should turn off any notes that are playing. </P>
