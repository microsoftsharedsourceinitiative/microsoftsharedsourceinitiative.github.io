<P>Each <B>IOP</B> has an <B>IOP_timer</B> member that the IOS initially sets to 15 (7.5 seconds). On each subsequent timer interrupt (approximately twice per second), the IOS decrements by one/half second the corresponding <B>IOP_timer</B> member in each outstanding <B>IOP</B>. If the <B>IOP_timer</B> member in any <B>IOP</B> becomes zero before the packet is freed, the IOS sends the AEP_TIMEOUT command to the asynchronous event routines for all drivers. </P>

<P>In this case, the IOS sets the <B>AEP_i_t_o_iop</B> member to the address of the affected <B>IOP</B>. If a driver has already processed this <B>IOP</B>, that driver sets the <B>AEP_result</B> member to zero; otherwise, it sets the member to nonzero. If a driver has processed the request but the adapter has failed to respond, the driver can correct the problem, such as resetting the adapter. If a driver is queuing the request and has not yet processed the request, it can simply reset the <B>IOP_timer</B> member with the value in the <B>IOP_orig_timer</B> field. </P>
