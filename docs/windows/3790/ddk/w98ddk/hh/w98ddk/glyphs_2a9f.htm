<P>If a printer vendor believes there is added value in providing ICM functionality in the driver or in the device hardware, the driver can inform the GDI device that it is an ICM-enabled printer driver. It does this by setting the C1_ICM bit in the <I>dpCaps1</I> field of the GDIINFO structure during a <B>DevEnable</B> call.</P>

<P>In this case, the printer driver needs to define and export the functions in the following list. Except for <A HREF="glyphs_4227.htm"><B>CMColorInfo</B></A>, these functions are described in the Platform SDK documentation.</P>

<P class=indent1><B>CMCheckColorsInGamut</B></P>

<P class=indent1><B>CMColorInfo</B></P>

<P class=indent1><B>CMCreateTransform</B></P>

<P class=indent1><B>CMDeleteTransform</B></P>

<P class=indent1><B>CMGetInfo</B></P>

<P class=indent1><B>CMTranslateRGB</B></P>

<P class=indent1><B>CMTranslateRGBs</B></P>

<P>These functions are called by the operating system to allow the driver to provide the necessary ICM support. Whenever any of these functions are called, the driver checks the <B>dmICMMethod</B> member of the DEVMODE structure to determine whether ICM on the host has been selected. If it has been selected, the driver calls the GDI device using the following helper functions. The operating system continues to perform the color management. If the driver itself is ICM enabled, its functions are always called instead.</P>

<P>The following is a list of valid GDI callback functions.   </P>

<P class=indent1><B>ICMCheckColorsInGamut</B></P>

<P class=indent1><B>ICMCreateTransform</B></P>

<P class=indent1><B>ICMDeleteTransform</B></P>

<P class=indent1><B>ICMGetInfo</B></P>

<P class=indent1><B>ICMTranslateRGB</B></P>

<P class=indent1><B>ICMTranslateRGBs</B></P>

<P>If the <B>dmICMMethod</B> member of the DEVMODE structure specifies that ICM should be done in the driver or the graphics device, the driver should not call GDI but should instead manage its own color transform and translate the colors as requested by the operating system. When a drawing call comes to the driver, the <B>ICMCXform</B> member of the DRAWMODE structure contains the driver-created transform function that performs the color transformations.</P>
