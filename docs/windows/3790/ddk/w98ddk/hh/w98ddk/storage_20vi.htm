<P>This service is used by IOS layer drivers located in the IOS layered driver hierarchy. IOS clients should use <B>ILB_io_criteria_rtn</B> instead.  </P>

<P>The service ensures that total transfer count does not exceed the maximum allowed, checks for too many logical SGDs (Scatter-Gather Descriptors), and optionally audits linear buffer start addresses and buffer lengths for WORD or DWORD alignment.</P>

<P>If this service has been so requested, it will generate a list of physical SGDs into memory pointed to by <B>IOR_sgd_lin_phys</B>. It will work from either a single linear address (IORF_SCATTER_GATHER=FALSE) or from a linear scatter-gather list (IORF_SCATTER_GATHER=TRUE). In the latter case, the SGD list is terminated with a zero-count SGD. </P>

<P>The physical SGD conversion service is performed by calling the <B>_CopyPageTable</B> function to obtain the list of page table entries (PTEs) that correspond to the linear address space(s) specified. Next, the service routine attempts to concatenate PTEs whose physical addresses are contiguous, into a single physical SGD if possible. The maximum allowed size of each physical SGD is 65535 bytes; this limit will be observed while concatenating physical SGDs. If the processing of the linear address space(s) results in too many physical SGDs being created (<B>IOR_num_sgds</B> becomes greater than the smaller of 17 or  <B>DCB_max_sg_elements</B>), the io_criteria routine reports an error. This service fails if any linear buffer (pointed to by <B>IOR_buffer_ptr</B> or the SGD field <B>BD_SG_Buffer_Ptr</B>) being processed is larger than 512K.</P>

<P>A successful call is indicated if the EAX register returns 0.</P>

<P>If this call is unsuccessful, it generally indicates that IOS needs to perform double-buffering to successfully complete the request; set the IORF_DOUBLE_BUFFER bit in IOR_flags before calling IOS_SendCommand.</P>

<P>The following table lists the fields used by this service.</P>
