<P>The registry is set up when the device is first installed and recognized by the bus enumerator. This is initiated by Configuration Manager when a device node is created for which a device ID is not contained in the registry. If the device has not been previously configured, Configuration Manager calls the Device Manager to set up the registry for the device. The Device Manager will look up the Device ID entry in the appropriate device information (.INF) file and the resource information in the drivers which already exist in the default driver directory. If a default driver is found, its configuration information is copied to the registry and the driver is loaded. If no driver is found the user will be prompted to initiate an installation process. </P>

<P>When the Device Manager has completed the setup of the registry, the Configuration Manager will complete the setup of the device node for the device. If an overriding logical configuration exists in the registry it will be used for the device, and the logical configuration that was defined by the PCMCIA bus enumerator will be discarded. </P>
