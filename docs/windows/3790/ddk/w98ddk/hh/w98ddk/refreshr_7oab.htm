<H1><A NAME="_refreshr_custom_refresh_rates"></A>Custom Refresh Rates</H1>

<P>The OEM Service Release (OSR) 2 release of the Microsoft® Windows® 95 operating system introduced custom refresh rates for video displays. For this feature to function properly with OEM-provided control panels, refresh rate information must be stored in the registry in a consistent manner. This section describes the correct method for storing custom refresh rate information in the registry.</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you implement custom refresh rates, the format of INF files for display driver installation and registry settings should be implemented as specified in the Windows® 98 Device Driver Kit (DDK).</P>

<P>If you implement a custom control panel, follow the guidelines defined in the Windows® 98 Platform SDK documentation. The specific references are provided in this documentation under the topic Reference Sources. Also, manufacturer-provided control panel applications should not disable default Windows functionality, including refresh rate setting. (This is a PC 97 requirement.)</P>

<P>When custom refresh rates are implemented for a display driver, the Windows 98 Display Control Panel program is responsible for setting five registry entries in the locations summarized in this documentation.</P>

<H4>Registry Entry 1</H4>

<PRE>\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Display
    <I>\&lt;display #&gt;</I>\DEFAULT\RefreshRate 
 </PRE>

<P>This entry should only contain one of two possible values. A value of zero selects the default refresh rate. A value of –1 selects the optimal refresh rate. This value is superseded if a custom refresh rate has been specified in Entry 2 for the current mode.</P>

<H4>Registry Entry 2</H4>

<PRE>\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Display
    <I>\&lt;display#&gt;</I>\MODES\<I>&lt;bit depth&gt;</I>
    \<I>&lt;horizontal resolution&gt;</I>,<I>&lt;vertical resolution&gt;</I>\RefreshRate
 </PRE>

<P>For each specific mode, this entry contains the custom rate to be used in that mode. If the entry does not exist, the display's <B>DEFAULT\RefreshRate</B> value in Entry 1 will be used. The entry should not exist if the user has never selected a custom refresh rate for that particular mode. Note that a separate custom refresh rate is maintained for every mode and specific rates should not be stored in the <B>DEFAULT\RefreshRate</B> key.</P>

<P>The Class Installer is responsible for setting Entry 3 through Entry 5 as follows, based on information in the INF files for the display adapter and monitor:</P>

<H4>Registry Entry 3</H4>

<P>Set by Windows when calling <B>ChangeDisplaySettings</B> with CDS_UPDATEREGISTRY specified. </P>

<PRE>\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Display
    \<I>&lt;display #&gt;</I>\MODES\8
    \<I>&lt;horizontal resolution&gt;</I>,<I>&lt;vertical resolution&gt;</I>\DEFAULT
 </PRE>

<P>For each resolution, this entry contains a comma-delimited list of valid refresh rates for that resolution. Note that this list is usually specified only for 8-bit modes, because refresh rates are usually independent of color depth. This entry is read by Control Panel when giving the user a list of custom refresh rates.</P>

<P>If the refresh rates supported by your display device are not independent of color depth, you can specify additional registry entries for each mode for which this is true. In other words, for each mode, Windows uses the refresh rates listed for that exact resolution and color depth if the registry entry is present. If the registry entry for that mode is not present, Windows uses the refresh rates specified for the mode with the same resolution and 8-bit color depth.</P>

<P>The following shows the registry entry for modes that are not 8 bits per pixel (bpp) that support a different set of refresh rates than the 8-bpp mode at the same resolution:</P>

<PRE>\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Display
    <I>\&lt;display #&gt;</I>\MODES\&lt;color depth&gt;
    \&lt;horizontal resolution&gt;,&lt;vertical resolution&gt;\DEFAULT
 </PRE>

<P>The refresh rates offered to the user as custom refresh rates depend on information stored in the registry under Entry 3. The INF file of the display adapter should list all refresh rates it is capable of supporting. If a monitor is installed on the system, the list of available refresh rates should be limited by the maximum rate supported by the monitor in the given resolution.</P>

<H4>Registry Entry 4</H4>

<P>Used for multiple hardware configurations.</P>

<PRE>\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Config\&lt;config #&gt;\Display\Settings\RefreshRate
 </PRE>

<H4>Registry Entry 5</H4>

<P>Contains currently active settings.</P>

<PRE>\\HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG\Display\Settings\RefreshRate</PRE>
