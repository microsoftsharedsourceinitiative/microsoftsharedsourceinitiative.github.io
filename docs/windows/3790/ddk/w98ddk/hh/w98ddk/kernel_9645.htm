<P>A synchronization problem that can occur in a system with preemptive priorities is that threads that own system resources may not be able to run when other, higher priority threads are executing. This can cause a situation in which a thread remains blocked on a resource owned by a thread that is unable to run. If threads at a higher priority than the resource owning thread do not block, the resource may never be freed. To prevent this problem, the system uses a technique called priority inversion prevention in which the system boosts the priority of the thread that owns a resource to at least the priority of any thread that blocks on the resource. </P>

<P>The Windows 95 time slicer's algorithm for priority-inversion-prevention is associative. This means that, once a priority inversion boost is in place, the boosted thread maintains the same priority as the boosting thread. </P>

<P>When threads are suspended by events not related to blocking on resources, they will simply lose their current time slice, and will not be block boosted. </P>
