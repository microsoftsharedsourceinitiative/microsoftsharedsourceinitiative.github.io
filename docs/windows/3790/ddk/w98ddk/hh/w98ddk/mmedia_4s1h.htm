<P>The DDK includes several sample MCI device drivers. While one sample illustrates how to write MCI device drivers for VCR devices, you can use it to understand how MCI device drivers work and adapt it for other devices. The following samples are included with the DDK: </P>

<P>The MCIQA sample provides a shell for an MCI device driver. This shell provides the basic structure needed for MCI operation. </P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample code for the MCIWAVE, MCISEQ, and MCICDA device drivers is not included with the DDK. These MCI drivers are written to be device independent by using standard calls to the audio drivers and the MSCDEX drivers. </P>
