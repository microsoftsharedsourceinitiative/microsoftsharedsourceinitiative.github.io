<P>The primary function of USBCAMD is to manage an isochronous stream from the device and allow the cam driver to extract video frames from the stream and perform any processing on them before they are returned to the calling application. USBCAMD handles all the synchronization, start, stop, and error recovery issues associated with maintaining the ISO stream on the USB. The cam minidriver determines if the data is valid and part of the current video frame, or part of the next frame, and indicates this to USBCAMD. The device-specific functions (such as properties) are handled by the cam minidriver as well as support for additional non-ISO streams (for example, still image).</P>

<P>USB cameras that support a single isochronous data stream where synchronization information (start of video frames) is embedded in the data stream are ideal for USBCAMD.</P>
