<P>WMI was developed to provide a set of instrumentation capabilities that are tightly linked to the driver models found in the Windows family of operating systems. Additionally, because WMI uses the same schema as WBEM, it integrates extremely well into the three-tiered approach to instrumentation infrastructure. As WMI is focused on the task of instrumenting data, it uses WBEM both as the central management data repository and as the access point for management applications to this data. This fact makes it more appropriate to compare DMI to WBEM, rather than to WMI, as discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>

<P>Existing instrumentation technologies, such as DMI and SNMP, provide more of a two-tiered approach to instrumenting data and providing it to consumers of management data (these data consumers are typically management applications). The difficulty with this approach is that for a single consumer of management data to understand both DMI and SNMP data, the developer of the management application must do twice as much work — he or she must write an application that can understand two different systems of communicating and representing instrumented data. However, in the WBEM/CIM environment, the WBEM services provide an abstraction layer. Data from many sources can be provided to the CIM schema managed by WBEM (sources could include WMI, Win32, DMI, SNMP, and CMIP), and a management application can use WBEM to access all this data.</P>

<P>Besides the lack of a common abstraction layer, DMI does not provide a set of programming interfaces that are tightly integrated with the Windows operating system and its driver models. DMI was not designed with Windows Plug and Play and Power Management in mind. However, Microsoft understands that smooth migration of existing instrumentation technologies and management applications is key to the success of WBEM. </P>

<P>The WBEM infrastructure will provide a facility that maps DMI information into the CIM schema managed by WBEM. This capability is facilitated by WBEM's ability to support multiple instrumentation data providers — sample providers include those for WMI and Win32 data. Intel Corporation is developing the functionality to allow DMI data to be mapped into CIM, and conversely, to allow CIM data to be accessible to existing DMI- or WMI-based management applications.</P>
