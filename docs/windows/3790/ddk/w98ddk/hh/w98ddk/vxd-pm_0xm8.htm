<P class=proch><B><IMG SRC="../images/wedge.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>When the system wakes, the configuration manager and device drivers work together to determine the source of the wake up as follows</B>

<OL>
	<LI>When a bus driver finds that its bus is signaling wake up (either by hardware mechanisms or by receiving a CONFIG_WAKEUP message itself), it uses the mechanisms defined in the standard for that type of bus to determine which children are signaling wake up.</LI>

	<LI>For each child device that is signaling wake up, the bus driver calls the configuration manager service <A HREF="vxd-pm_1kmo.htm"><B>Device_Wakeup</B></A>.</LI>

	<LI>The configuration manager then sends a CONFIG_WAKEUP message to the device. </LI>

	<LI>Upon receiving a CONFIG_WAKEUP message, the device driver begins handling the wake-up event. This may require turning the device on by calling the configuration manager  <A HREF="vxd-pm_3a79.htm"><B>Set_DevNode_PowerState</B></A> service. If the device driver is a bus driver, it should repeat the process at step 1. </LI>
</OL>

<P>In summary, at system wake up, bus drivers call <B>Device_Wakeup</B> on any of their children that are signaling wake up. Device and bus drivers must listen and handle CONFIG_WAKEUP messages.</P>
