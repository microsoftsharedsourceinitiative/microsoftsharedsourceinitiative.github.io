<P>The International Color Consortium (ICC) has specified an industry standard file format for device color characterization information. ICM technology in Windows uses these ICC profiles to move color into and out of device color space to produce more accurate colors in output devices.</P>

<P>In order to take advantage of ICM, printer vendors should ship ICC profiles that characterize their devices. These profiles are specified as dependent files in the INF file and are installed in the system as part of the INF-based printer installation. An example is provided in <A HREF="glyphs_3a26.htm">INF File Syntax For Profile Installation</A>.</P>

<P>If the printer vendor is providing an installation program, this program should copy the profiles to the COLOR directory and call standard Win32® APIs to install the profiles in the system. It should also associate those profiles with the printer being installed. </P>
