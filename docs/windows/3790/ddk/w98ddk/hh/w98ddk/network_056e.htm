<P>WNNC_START </P>

<P>Returns a value to indicate if the provider is likely to start. MPR may call this function during its startup to determine the state of the provider. For example, when MPR is trying to restore persistent connections, and a provider is not responding, it will use this to determine if it should retry and how long. A provider should return WNNC_START_WONT if it knows it will not start (for example, if it is in some unrecoverable failure mode) so MPR will not retry. Otherwise, it should either return the estimated start time in number of milliseconds, or WNNC_START_UNKNOWN to mean it doesn't know. If WNNC_START_UNKNOWN is returned, MPR will use some default time-out. If it turns out the provider has started by the time this call is issued, it can return WNNC_START_DONE. A provider should return WNNC_START_INACTIVE if it cannot access the network at the moment, but may be able to in the future (such as when the PCMCIA net card is removed from the computer, or the computer is undocked, essentially when the client is unable to run a transport). </P>
