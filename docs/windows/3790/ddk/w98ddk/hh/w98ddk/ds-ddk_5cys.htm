<P>DirectX is built for speed. It allows game authors unprecedented access to the display and audio hardware, while insulating them from the specific details of that hardware. In keeping with these design goals, DirectSound is not a high-level API. Instead, DirectSound provides a device-independent interface that allows applications to take advantage of the capabilities of the audio hardware. For applications, DirectSound provides access to audio features such that hardware acceleration can be used whenever available. For sound card manufacturers, DirectSound provides a set of audio features that can be implemented in hardware such that existing DirectSound applications immediately benefit from the acceleration. </P>

<P>Features not supported directly in hardware are emulated in software by DirectSound without any loss of functionality. Applications can query DirectSound to determine the capabilities of the audio hardware. A high-performance application can use this information to scale its audio features. For example, applications might use several more sounds if hardware-accelerated mixing is supported by the audio hardware. </P>

<P>DirectSound accesses the sound hardware through the DirectSound hardware abstraction layer (HAL), an interface that is implemented by the audio device driver. This driver consists of a Windows 95 audio device driver that has been modified to support the HAL; this provides backward compatibility with existing Windows-based applications. The DirectSound HAL provides the following functionality: 

<UL>
	<LI>Acquires and releases control of the audio hardware. </LI>

	<LI>Describes the capabilities of the audio hardware. </LI>

	<LI>When hardware is available, performs the requested operation. </LI>

	<LI>When hardware is unavailable, fails the requested operation. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The device driver must not perform any software emulation. Its sole purpose is to report the capabilities of the hardware to DirectSound, and to pass DirectSound requests to the hardware. If the requested operation cannot be performed by the hardware, the device driver should simply fail the request. The operation is then emulated in software by DirectSound. </P>

<P>If a DirectSound driver is not available, DirectSound communicates with the audio hardware through the standard Windows 95 or Windows 3.1 audio device driver. In this case, all DirectSound features are still available through software emulation, but hardware acceleration is not accessible. </P>
