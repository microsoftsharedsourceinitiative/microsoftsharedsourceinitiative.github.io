<P>This service is provided to fill the heap spare block. The heap spare block contains a few pages of memory that can be used for emergency allocation purposes by the heap manager in the IFS manager. Typically, it can be used for allocations during system critical errors if there is insufficient memory. By filling the heap spare block, an FSD can ensure that it can allocate memory in a critical situation. The IFS manager itself makes sure the heap spare is filled on every API into it. This routine should be called only at application execution time. It cannot be called at interrupt time or critical event time.
