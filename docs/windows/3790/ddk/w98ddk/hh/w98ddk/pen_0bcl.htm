<H1><A NAME="_pss_3455"></A>Purpose of the Pen Driver</H1>

<P>The main purposes of the pen driver (PENC.DRV) are to: 

<UL>
	<LI>Send data received from the virtual pen driver to Windows 95 clients, such as the Pen Services for Windows 95 system component, PENWIN.DLL. </LI>

	<LI>Respond to messages sent by clients using the Windows <B>SendDriverMessage</B> function. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The pen driver is completely independent of the hardware. The OEM developer need not modify any portion of the PENC.DRV module so this section may be of little interest to a pen device OEM. The purpose of this section is to document the Windows messages that the pen driver recognizes in case the OEM wants to write a pen application (for example, an application that tests or demonstrates the vendor's pen device). The Windows messages recognized by the pen driver are documented in summary form in Appendix D of the <I>Programmer's Guide to Pen Services for Microsoft Windows 95</I>. This section of the Windows 95 DDK gives more details about each message. </P>
