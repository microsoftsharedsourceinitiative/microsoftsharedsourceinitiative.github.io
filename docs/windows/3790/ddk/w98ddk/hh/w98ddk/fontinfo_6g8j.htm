<P>The remaining controls in the CTT dialog box allow you to specify a character code or device-command/character-code sequence which maps a character code (or device-command/character-code sequence) to a particular entry in the Windows ANSI set.</P>

<P>For example, the character code 161 in the Windows ANSI character set is an inverted exclamation point. If this character is available on the printer, the required printer commands should be placed in the control labeled 161 in the translation table. If the character from the Windows ANSI set is not available, the default character for that font should be placed at that location in the character-translation table instead.</P>

<P>There are three types of character-translation tables. UniTool will determine which one is appropriate to save the CTT file based on the information that was entered.</P>

<P>The first type is a simple 1-to-1 translation, where each character code consists of a single byte. In this type of CTT, the Universal Printer Driver will send the character value that was entered in the edit control every time that the ASCII value shown before the edit control is requested.</P>

<P>The second type is a 2-to-1 translation, where each character code consists of either one of two characters. In this type of CTT, the Universal Printer Driver will send the first character value that was entered in the edit control, and then use either a backspace character or x-movement commands to move the current position back to where it was before the first character was printed. The Universal Printer Driver then sends the second character.</P>

<P>The third type is a variable-length translation, where each character code consists of a variable length string containing a printer command. In this type of CTT, the Universal Printer Driver sends the command that was entered in the edit control when the edit control value is requested.</P>

<P>Once you have created a CTT, you should begin entering the commands and data associated with the Font Info command in the Printer Data menu.</P>
