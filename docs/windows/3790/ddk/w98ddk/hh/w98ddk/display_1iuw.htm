<H4>Call With</H4>

<P>EAX: Contains the value to be written to port (OUT operations only). </P>

<P>EBX: Contains the VM handle for which the I/O is being done. </P>

<P>ECX: Contains the I/O type flags (see VMM.INC for details). </P>

<P>EDX: Contains the port number for which I/O is being done. </P>

<P>EBP: Points to the VM's Client Registers. </P>

<H4>Return Values</H4>

<P>EAX contains the result of an IN operation. NC indicates that the Main VDD should handle the I/O. All registers should be preserved in this case. CY indicates that the mini-VDD handled the I/O. In this case, only preserve EBX. </P>

<H4>Remarks</H4>

<P>A mini-VDD can hook this routine if it needs to examine or virtualize I/O to ports which were previously registered with the Main VDD via the <B>VDD_Register_Virtual_Port</B> service. Normally, the Main VDD uses ports registered with this service simply to notify it of when to restore the Windows VM state when running a VGA application in a window. Then, I/O to these ports is always done physically (the I/O request is always done to the hardware). However, in some cases (see S3.VXD for an example), the mini-VDD needs to perform special handling or virtualization of these BLTer ports. By hooking this service, the mini-VDD will have the chance to virtualize the I/O to all ports previously registered by <B>VDD_Register_Virtual_Port</B>. If the mini-VDD has no interest in the port, it simply returns NC. If the mini-VDD handles the port and completes the I/O virtualization, it returns CY causing the Main VDD not to do its normal physical I/O to the port. </P>
