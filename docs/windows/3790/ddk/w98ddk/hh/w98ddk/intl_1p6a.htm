<P>Following are the types of applications: 

<UL>
	<LI>IME-unaware applications: This type of application never intends to control the IME. However, if the application accepts DBCS characters, the user can enter any DBCS character into the application using IME. </LI>

	<LI>IME half-aware applications: This type of application typically controls various contexts of IME, such as open and closed, composition form, and so on, but it does not display any user interface for IME. </LI>

	<LI>IME full-aware applications: This type of application is typically responsible for displaying any information given to it by IME. </LI>
</UL>

<P>In Windows 95, one IME-unaware application is supported with one default IME window and one default input context. </P>

<P>An IME half-aware application creates its own IME windows using the predefined IME class and may or may not handle its own input context. </P>

<P>An IME full-aware application handles the input context by itself. It displays any necessary information given by the input context. It does not use the IME window. </P>
