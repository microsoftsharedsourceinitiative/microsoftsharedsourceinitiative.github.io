<P>To enable communications output, a port driver should provide a <B>PortWrite</B> function. For port drivers that use a transmit queue, the <B>PortWrite</B> function writes to the queue and returns immediately; an interrupt service routine actually sends the data. For port drivers that do not use a transmit queue, the <B>PortWrite</B> function sends the data and then returns. To enable a VCOMM client to resume transmission after a communications error, a port driver should provide a <B>PortClearError</B> function. </P>

<P>A port driver's <B>PortTransmitChar</B> function sends a high-priority character, such as an event character, ahead of any characters in the transmit queue. Typically, the port driver does not send the character immediately, but stores it in a special one-character buffer. The function can fail (return FALSE) if a character specified in a previous call is still waiting to be sent. </P>

<P>To enable communications input, a port driver should provide a <B>PortRead</B> function. For output-only devices, such as LPT ports, the <B>PortRead</B> function should simply return TRUE (success), and indicate zero bytes read. For port drivers that use a receive queue, the <B>PortRead</B> function should retrieve data from the receive queue and return immediately; an interrupt service routine actually reads data into the receive queue. The amount of data retrieved from the queue may be less than the amount requested. For port drivers that do not use a receive queue, the <B>PortRead</B> function actually reads data from the device. The amount of data read is less than the amount requested only if a read time-out occurs, in which case the return value is FALSE. </P>

<P>A port driver's <B>PortGetQueueStatus</B> function retrieves the status of the receive and transmit queues. A port driver's <B>PortPurge</B> function discards the contents of the transmit or receive queue. </P>
