<P>This service queues an event that is to be called at the earliest time it is safe to do so, such as no pending hardware interrupts. Unlike the IFSMgr_SchedEvent time-out mentioned above, there is no time-out before the event function is called.

<TD width=66%>This causes a priority event to be scheduled to run on a thread that does not own the critical section. This flag should be used for events that can cause context switches and do not need a critical section to run in. This flag cannot be used in combination with EVF_VMEVENT but can be used in combination with EVF_TASKTIME. </TD>

<TD width=34%>EVF_NOTNESTEXEC </TD>
<TD width=66%>This causes a restricted event to be scheduled that runs only when there is no nested execution in progress. It can be scheduled as a global or a VM event; EVF_VMEVENT can be passed in combination with this flag. In addition, EVF_TASKTIME can also be specified to indicate whether an IOREQ is needed or not. An event that can cause a nested execution to happen should use this flag. Otherwise, it can lead to deadlock situations. </TD>
