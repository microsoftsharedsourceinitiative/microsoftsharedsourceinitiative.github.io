<P>The Memory Config button displays a dialog box which contains a list of possible printer memory configurations. If your printer supports Hewlett-Packard PCL and the driver supports downloadable fonts, you should select all possible memory configurations available for your device. A memory configuration is defined as the amount of RAM available on the printer to store raster bitmap graphics and downloaded font information. The Universal Printer Driver will use this information to make sure it does not send more data to the printer than it is capable of handling. If the user attempts to print a document requiring more available memory than the printer possesses, the Universal Printer Driver will display an error message and send only as much information as the device can process.</P>

<P>The value in the left column specifies the amount of memory available to the Universal Printer Driver to store downloaded font data and bitmap raster data. The value in the right column specifies the amount of memory that will be displayed as available. Because the printer typically reserves some memory for its own use, these two values are rarely the same. The list of memory configurations ranges from 65K/128K to 5212K/5.5M.</P>

<H4>Diconix 150 Plus</H4>

<P>For the Diconix 150 Plus printer, no memory configurations have been selected.</P>

<H4>HP LaserJet IIP</H4>

<P>For the HP LaserJet IIP printer, the 369/512K, 1419K/1.5M, 2243K/2.5M, 3467K/3.5M and 4491K/4.5M configurations are selected. The HP LaserJet IIP comes with 512K of memory.</P>

<P>At this point, you should have initialized all of the necessary data for your minidriver. You can build the driver by exiting the UniTool application, entering MS-DOS, and moving to the directory that contains your driver files. Type the xmsmake command to compile and link your minidriver. </P>
