<P>The default Dial-Up Adapter (Microsoft Dial-Up Adapter) is PPPMAC. PPPMAC handles a modem device and has three default Session Management Modules--NWC, PPP, and RAS. When the modem connection was established, Dial-Up Networking gets the device class of the modem from TAPI's lineGetID call for the "ndis" type. The Unimodem service provider returns the "COM" device class for the modem. Dial-Up Networking looks for the Dial-Up adapters from the .../REMOTEACCESS/AUTHENCATION/CLASS/COM key and finds PPPMAC as the only adapter. Then Dial-Up Networking enumerates the Session Management Modules for PPPMAC from the .../REMOTEACCESS/AUTHENCATION/-DRIVERS/PPPMAC key, starting from PPP type. When Dial-Up Networking is ready to hand off the control to the SMM, it looks up the Path value in the .../REMOTEACCESS/AUTHENCATION/SMM_FILES/PPP key for the DLL name, loads it and starts the session management phase. </P>
