<P><B>IRP_MJ_FLUSH_BUFFERS</B> is received by a filter pin to flush the state of the stream. This is typically sent by a proxy when a flush request is received from another connection instance. There are no parameters to this IRP. A pin does not need to support this IRP if it does not queue data or have a stream state that is modified by the progression of data, such as a codec doing interframe compression.</P>
