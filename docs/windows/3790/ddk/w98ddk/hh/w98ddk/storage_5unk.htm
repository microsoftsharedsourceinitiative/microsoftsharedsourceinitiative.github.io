<P>An IR_FSD_MOUNT operation is performed when the disk is initially accessed and when the media has changed. The FSD should examine the disk volume and determine if it recognizes the file system disk format. If the volume is recognized, the FSD should save the information it requires about the volume and return a handle for the volume. The IFS manager uses the returned volume handle to indicate to the FSD which disk volume a path-named I/O request should be performed on. The volume handle is also used to track the disk volumes that may be in a removable media drive. </P>

<P>The FSD must verify if the disk volume has already been mounted. If it has been previously mounted then the previously returned system volume handle and FSD volume handle should be returned. Otherwise the disk volume will be considered a separate volume. </P>

<P>If the FSD determines that the media is a new volume, the FSD should save the system volume handle and drive identifier. The system volume handle should be used by the FSD during disk I/O requests to identify the disk volume to the I/O system. The drive identifier should be used by the FSD during a mount to verify that a previously mounted volume is on the same drive. </P>
