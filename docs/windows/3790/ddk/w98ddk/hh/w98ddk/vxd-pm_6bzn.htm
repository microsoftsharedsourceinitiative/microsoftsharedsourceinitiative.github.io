<P>Since the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) driver is the parent of all other devices in the system, as well as the motherboard driver, there are additional actions it must take:</P>

<P>At every system wake, the ACPI driver must check the ACPI general-purpose status (GP_STS) bits for any wake-up device and call the configuration manager <A HREF="vxd-pm_1kmo.htm"><B>Device_Wakeup</B></A> service accordingly.</P>

<P>The ACPI driver must listen to CONFIG_START messages for any device in the system. If the ACPI driver has information about that device, it must update the capabilities bitmap by calling <A HREF="vxd-pm_8lgz.htm"><B>Get_DevNode_PowerCapabilities</B></A>, adding additional capabilities, and calling <A HREF="vxd-pm_2m2b.htm"><B>Set_DevNode_PowerCapabilities</B></A> to set the device node's capabilities.</P>

<P>The ACPI driver must also provide the system power with a state-to-device power state mapping table for any devices it controls by calling <A HREF="vxd-pm_40rp.htm"><B>Set_DevNode_PowerStateTable</B></A>. (Bus drivers other than the ACPI driver do not need to handle this table because the configuration manager copies the parent's table to a new device node by default).</P>

<P>When the ACPI driver receives a CONFIG_START message for any device configured using ACPI, the driver must first power on the device before running any Plug and Play control methods.</P>
