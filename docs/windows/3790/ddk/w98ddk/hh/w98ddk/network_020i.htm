<P>Windows NT/Windows 2000 and Windows 95 handle EISA and MCA cards differently at initialization. The Windows NT/Windows 2000 registry handles all card IDs and slot registration. In Windows 95, the driver must contain the actual MCA card ID. </P>

<P>If your Windows 95 driver supports more than one type of MCA card, list the ID for each card in your source code. See the NE2000 or the IBMTOK samples for examples of MCA cards. Lists of EISA cards are no longer required. </P>

<P>For Windows 95, SLOTNUMBER is not needed within the Protocol.ini file. For EISA cards, Windows 95 relies on the Configuration Manager to tell NDIS what slot the card is in. For MCA cards, NDIS will scan all the slots looking for an ID that matches. SLOTNUMBER may be used for MCA cards if more than one of a given card is used in a computer and a way to differentiate the two is needed. </P>
