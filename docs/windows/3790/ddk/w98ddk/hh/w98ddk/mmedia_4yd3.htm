<P>Contains information needed by an Audio Compression Manager (ACM) driver when opened with a DRV_OPEN message. The <I>lParam2</I> parameter of the <B>acmDriverProc</B> function will contain a pointer to this structure during the DRV_OPEN message. </P>

<H4>Members</H4>

<DL>
<DT><B>cbStruct</B> </DT>

<DD>Size, in bytes, of the <B>ACMDRVOPENDESC</B> structure. This member will be initialized by the ACM before calling the driver. This member can be greater than the size, in bytes, of the base <B>ACMDRVOPENDESC</B> structure. An ACM driver should ignore any members that are not contained in the base <B>ACMDRVOPENDESC</B> structure. This member should not be modified by the driver. </DD>

<DT><B>fccType</B> </DT>

<DD>Four-character code identifying the type of driver that is attempting to be opened. This member will be ACMDRIVERDETAILS_FCCTYPE_AUDIOCODEC (<I>audc</I>) for ACM drivers. An ACM driver should examine this member first and fail the DRV_OPEN message by returning zero if it is not equal to ACMDRIVERDETAILS_FCCTYPE_AUDIOCODEC. In case of failure, all remaining members should be ignored and remain unmodified. </DD>

<DT><B>fccComp</B> </DT>

<DD>Four-character code identifying the sub-type of the driver that is attempting to be opened. This member will currently be ACMDRIVERDETAILS_FCCCOMP_UNDEFINED (zero) for ACM drivers. An ACM driver should ignore this member. This member should not be modified by the driver. </DD>

<DT><B>dwVersion</B> </DT>

<DD>Version of the ACM that is opening the driver. This member will be equivalent to the value returned by <B>acmGetVersion</B>. An ACM driver can modify its behavior based on this value, but should not fail unless absolutely necessary. Future versions of the ACM will be backward-compatible with drivers written for previous versions of the ACM. This member should not be modified by the driver. </DD>

<DT><B>dwFlags</B> </DT>

<DD>This member defines flags used for opening an ACM driver. This member is identical to the <I>fdwOpen</I> parameter passed to <B>acmDriverOpen</B>. Currently, no flags are defined and this member should be ignored. This member should not be modified by the driver. </DD>

<DT><B>dwError</B> </DT>

<DD>If an ACM driver needs to fail the DRV_OPEN message for other reasons than an incompatible <B>fccType</B> (that is, the DRV_OPEN is for an ACM driver), this member must be set to the desired nonzero error code. This error code will be the return value from <B>acmDriverOpen</B>. This member is ignored if the driver succeeds the DRV_OPEN message (returns nonzero). </DD>

<DT><B>pszSectionName</B> </DT>

<DD>Address of a null-terminated string that specifies the name of the section in the SYSTEM.INI file where driver information is recorded. </DD>

<DT><B>pszAliasName</B> </DT>

<DD>Address of a null-terminated string that specifies the driver name or an alias under which the driver was loaded. </DD>

<DT><B>dnDevNode</B> </DT>

<DD>For plug-and-play drivers, this member identifies the device node for which the driver is being opened.
