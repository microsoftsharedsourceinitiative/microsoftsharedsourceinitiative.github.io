<P>A device loader loads and manages device drivers and enumerators for a given device node. Device loaders are typically used when devices are managed by various layers of device drivers. The device loader coordinates the work of the various layers and carries out general configuration tasks that apply to all device drivers. The Configuration Manager provides services that device loaders can use to carry out their tasks. </P>

<P>There are these services. </P>

<P>A device loader registers itself by using the <B>CONFIGMG_Register_DevLoader</B> service. This associates the device loader with the given device node. The device loader can also load an enumerator and device driver for the given device node or any child device nodes by using the <B>CONFIGMG_Load_DLVxD</B> service. It can also retrieve and assign private values to device nodes by using the <B>CONFIGMG_Get_Private_DWord</B> and <B>CONFIGMG_Set_Private_DWord</B> services. </P>

<P>You can retrieve the device descriptor block for any dynamically loaded virtual device associated with a device node by using the <B>CONFIGMG_Get_DDBs</B> service. </P>
