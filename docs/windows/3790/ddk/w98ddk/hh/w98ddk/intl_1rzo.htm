<P>The registry contains the Input Method key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel. The Input Method key has four value names: Perpendicular Distance, Parallel Distance, Perpendicular Tolerance, and Parallel Tolerance. The near caret operation IME can reference it. If these four value names are not specified, an near operation IME can set a default value. </P>

<TD width=35%>Perpendicular Distance </TD>
<TD width=65%>The distance is perpendicular to the text escapement. This is the perpendicular distance, in pixels, from the caret position to the composition window without font height and width. The near caret operation IME adjusts the composition window position according to this value and Parallel Distance. It is in REG_DWORD format. </TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=35%>Parallel Distance </TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=35%>Perpendicular Tolerance </TD>
<TD width=65%>The tolerance, in pixels, is perpendicular to the text escapement. This is the perpendicular distance from caret position to composition window. The near caret operation IME will not refresh its composition window if the caret movement is within this tolerance. It is in REG_DWORD format. </TD>
