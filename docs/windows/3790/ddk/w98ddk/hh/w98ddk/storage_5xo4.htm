<P>This service schedules a time-out for the time passed in and calls the event function passed in by the FSD when the time-out event occurs. Note that the event function may not be called immediately when the time-out occurs. If there are hardware interrupts or high priority events in progress, the event function will be called at the earliest possible time it is safe to do so. The event is always scheduled i.e. the callback will not be done immediately and it runs only when interrupts have been enabled in the VM. If the time parameter is set to zero, this function behaves similarly to IFSMGR_QueueEvent.

<TD width=34%>EVF_NOTNESTEXEC </TD>
<TD width=66%>This causes a restricted event to be scheduled that runs only when there is no nested execution in progress. It can be scheduled as a global or a VM event, that is, EVF_VMEVENT can be passed in combination with this flag. In addition, EVF_TASKTIME can also be specified to indicate whether an IOREQ is needed or not. An event that can cause a nested execution to happen should use this flag. Otherwise, it can lead to deadlock situations. </TD>
