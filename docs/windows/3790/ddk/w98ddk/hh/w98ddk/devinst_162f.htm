<PRE>[Manufacturer]

 </PRE>

<P>The <B>Manufacturer</B> section identifies a manufacturer of a device that can be installed using the INF file and names a <B>Device</B> section that describes that device. 

<DL>
<DT><I>manufacturer-name</I> </DT>

<DD>Name of the device manufacturer. This name can be any combination of printable characters, but must uniquely identify the manufacturer and must be enclosed in double quotation marks. </DD>

<DT><I>strings-key</I> </DT>

<DD>Name of a string defined in the <B>Strings</B> section of the INF file. </DD>

<DT><I>device-section-name</I> </DT>

<DD>Name of the <B>Device</B> section. This name can be any combination of printable characters, but must uniquely identify another section in the INF file. The <B>Device</B> section: 

<UL>
	<LI>Specifies a device description string for a device (device description strings may be displayed at the user interface by the New Device Wizard and/or by the Device manager). </LI>

	<LI>Specifies the name of the Install section for each of the devices (the Install section for a device gives the primary script for installing the device). </LI>

	<LI>Specifies the device ID (also called the hardware ID) of the device and, optionally, a list of compatible device IDs for the device. </LI>
</UL>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>The device ID specified in the Device section may be used in a ControlFlags section to modify the way the New Device Wizard and/or the Device Manager use the device description. The syntax and meaning of items that can be in a Device section and in a ControlFlags section are described later in this topic. </P>

<P>The syntax of a Device section is: </P>

<PRE>[&lt;device-section&gt;]
&lt;device-description&gt;=&lt;install-section-name,device-id&gt;[,&lt;compatible-device-id&gt;]...
[&lt;device-description&gt;=&lt;install-section-name,device-id&gt;[,&lt;compatible-device-id&gt;]...]</PRE>

<P>Each Device section item gives the device description, identifies the install-type section, and specifies the device ID for a device. Optionally, a Device section item may specify one or more device IDs of compatible devices. </P>

<P>There may be one or more items in the Device section, depending upon how many devices the INF file installs for a manufacturer. </P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=41%><I>device-description</I> </TD>
<TD width=59%>Description of a device to install. This can be any combination of printable characters or a strings key. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=41%><I>install-section-name</I> </TD>
<TD width=59%>Name of the <B>Install</B> section for this device. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=41%><I>device-id</I> </TD>
<TD width=59%>Identifier for this device. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=41%><I>compatible-device-id</I> </TD>
<TD width=59%>Identifier of a compatible device. More than one compatible-device identifier can be given, but each must be preceded with a comma. </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>This example shows a typical Device section containing one item. The name of the Install section for this device is SuperSCSI. The device-id is *PNPA000 and it is compatible with devices identified as *PnPA001. </P>

<PRE>[SCRUS]
%DevDesc1%  = SuperSCSI, *PNPA000, *PnPA001</PRE>

<P>For each driver installed using this INF file, the Device Manager and the New Device Wizard will use the information in the Manufacturer and Device sections to generate Driver Description, Manufacturer Name, DeviceID, and Compatibility List entries in the registry. </P>

<P>The device ID specified in the Device section may be used in a ControlFlags section to modify the way the New Device Wizard and/or the Device Manager use the device description. The syntax of the items that can be contained in a ControlFlags section is shown in the following: </P>

<PRE>[ControlFlags]
CopyfilesOnly=&lt;Device-id&gt;[,&lt;device-id&gt;]...
ExcludeFromSelect=&lt;Device-id&gt;[,&lt;device-id&gt;]...</PRE>

<P>The ControlFlags section provides a way to control how a device is handled both during installation and by the Device Manager. The Windows 95 New Device Wizard builds its list of installable devices by searching through INF files. The Device Manager also displays information about devices which originates in INF files. </P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=41%><I>CopyFilesOnly</I> </TD>
<TD width=59%>Listing a device-id in a <B>CopyFilesOnly</B> item will allow the user to choose the device in the New Device Wizard but will stop the Wizard from actually doing the installation. When the user chooses the device from the Wizard will only copy files to the destination directory. Typically, devices which are enumerated should be listed in a CopyFilesOnly item. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=41%><I>ExcludeFromSelect</I> </TD>
<TD width=59%>Listing the device-id of a device in an <B>ExcludeFromSelect</B> item will remove the device completely from the New Device Wizard. Optionally, an asterisk (*) can be specified in place of the id list. Doing this will set ExcludeFromSelect for all devices listed in this INF file. </TD>
