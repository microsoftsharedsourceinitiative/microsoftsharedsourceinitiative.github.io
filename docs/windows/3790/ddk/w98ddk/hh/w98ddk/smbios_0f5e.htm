<P>SMBIOS (formerly known as DMI BIOS) provides information configured by the manufacturer about a PC. The SMBIOS entry point is in the F0000-FFFFF address block, which contains the 32-bit address of the SMBIOS structure data. The structure data can reside anywhere in the 0–4G address space. One of the last problems to solve in terms of supplying system instrumentation and management data for Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) is surfacing the information present in SMBIOS. </P>

<P>Unfortunately, the BIOS ROM memory is inaccessible to user-mode applications on the Microsoft® Windows&nbsp;NT®/Windows®&nbsp;2000 platform. To alleviate this, Microsoft modified the operating system. Windows® 2000 (from build 1773 onward) contains the relevant changes that provide access to the SMBIOS data as part of WBEM. The changes in Windows NT/Windows 2000 are designed to&nbsp;support SMBIOS 2.1, but also support SMBIOS 2.0 with some caveats:

<UL>
	<LI>If only the SMBIOS 2.0 calling mechanism is available, the aggregate size of all of the tables must be less than 4 KB. Only the first 4 KB is surfaced by way of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). </LI>

	<LI>If only the SMBIOS 2.0 calling mechanism is available, any strings for tables other than tables zero to 22 are not collected. This is because tables 23 and higher are not defined; the SMBIOS 2.0 component cannot determine whether strings are present because the SMBIOS specification does not have a defining mechanism.</LI>
</UL>

<P>These restrictions do not apply if the SMBIOS data is presented using the SMBIOS 2.1 memory table format.</P>

<P>OEMs, IHVs, and ISVs can write a WBEM application that retrieves and parses data from the RawSMBiosTables Class from the WBEM WMI schema. An excerpt from the managed object format (MOF) file for the SMBIOS data is provided in the table in <A HREF="smbios_55k5.htm">SMBIOS Table</A>.</P>

<P>For information about MOF files and how to write WBEM applications, see the WBEM SDK, which was provided on the Windows NT/Windows 2000 WinHEC Special Edition DDK CD and will become part of the Microsoft Platform SDK. </P>
