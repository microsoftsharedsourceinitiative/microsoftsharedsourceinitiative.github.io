<H2><A NAME="_dxddk_the_directsound_hal_dsound"></A>The DirectSound HAL</H2>

<P>The purpose of the HAL is to describe the capabilities of the hardware to DirectSound and to pass requests from DirectSound to the hardware. If the hardware cannot handle the request, the HAL fails the call and DirectSound emulates the request in software. The HAL must never emulate functions in software; emulation is best performed by the optimized code in DirectSound. </P>

<P>The DirectSound HAL is implemented by DirectSound drivers that exist in ring 0 without any ring 3 component (that is, they are virtual device drivers, or VxDs). Typically this is the same VxD as the ring 0 component of the Windows 95 Wave driver. These DirectSound drivers are Plug and Play compliant, which means that instances of the drivers are created by the configuration manager rather than by DirectSound. After an instance of the driver is created, it must register with DirectSound by passing a pointer to its primary interface, <A HREF="ds-ddk_6stg.htm"><B>IDsDriver</B></A>. DirectSound then uses this interface to access the HAL, as well as other interfaces it creates through <B>IDsDriver</B>. When the configuration manager notifies the driver that the hardware has been removed, the driver again notifies DirectSound so that DirectSound can release the driver interfaces. </P>

<P>Other than this instantiation and notification procedure, the driver is simply required to respond correctly to DirectSound when it calls the driver interfaces. In addition to <B>IUnknown</B>, the following three interfaces are currently defined: <B>IDsDriver</B> (supported by the main driver object), <A HREF="ds-ddk_304k.htm"><B>IDsDriverBuffer</B></A> (supported by each sound buffer object), and <A HREF="ds-ddk_8elg.htm"><B>IDsDriverPropertySet</B></A> (optionally supported by any driver-created object). </P>
