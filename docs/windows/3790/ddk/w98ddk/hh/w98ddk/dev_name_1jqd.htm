<P>.sl [#] displays long logged exceptions just #, if specified. ".SL" like ".S" (above) displays information about logged exceptions, enabled with the ".T" command. ".SL" displays all of the registers at the time the entry was logged and also shows the system time (the time VMM started) of the entry. ".S" shows a condensed view and is used more often because more faults can be viewed at the same time and because most of the registers are of little importance to the fault.</P>

<P>".SL" also disables logging before it displays anything, so no more logging will be performed until ".T" is invoked again</P>
