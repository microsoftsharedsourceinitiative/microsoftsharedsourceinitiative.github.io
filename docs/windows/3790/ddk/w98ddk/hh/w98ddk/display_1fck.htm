<P>The loading and initialization of the mini-VDD is done very early in the boot sequence of Windows 95 at the <B>Device_Init</B> stage of VxD initialization. Your mini-VDD must implement the function <B>MiniVDD_Dynamic_Init</B>. <B>MiniVDD_Dynamic_Init</B> is called as soon as the mini-VDD is dynamically loaded by the Windows 95 Plug &amp; Play subsystem. </P>

<P>One of the main tasks that the function <B>MiniVDD_Dynamic_Init </B>must perform is hooking out the mini-VDD functions. To hook out the functions, first get the 32 bit flat address of the dispatch table from the Main VDD via the VxDCall <B>VDD_Get_Mini_Dispatch_Table</B>. After obtaining the address of the dispatch table, use the <B>MiniVDDDispatch</B> macro found in MINIVDD.INC to hook out the functions that you need. Refer to any of the example mini-VDDs to see how to call <B>VDD_Get_Mini_Dispatch_Table </B>and how to hook out functions. </P>

<P>There are several other tasks that <B>MiniVDD_Dynamic_Init</B> must perform. See <B>MiniVDD_Dynamic_Init</B> for complete details. </P>
