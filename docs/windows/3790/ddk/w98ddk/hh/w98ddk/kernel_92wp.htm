<P>Moves the current virtual machine to the protected-mode locked stack. Doing so serves two purposes: It helps ensure that the client stack does not overflow (in case the client was previously on a very small private stack), and it ensures that the memory used by the stack is always available. Uses Flags. 

<UL>
	<LI>Returns the address of the locked stack in Client_SS and Client_SP if the stack was not already locked. Otherwise, these registers remain unchanged. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Before calling this service, the virtual device must ensure that the current virtual machine is running in protected mode. This means the VMStat_PM_Exec value must be specified in the <B>CB_VM_Status</B> field of the control block for the virtual machine. </P>

<P>The <B>Begin_Nest_Exec</B> service automatically switches to the locked stack if the system determines that the virtual machine should be placed into (or be left in) protected-mode execution. Since most virtual devices rely on the <B>Begin_Nest_Exec</B> service to switch stacks, this service is only useful for virtual devices, such as the virtual PIC device, which explicitly change the execution mode of a virtual machine. </P>

<P>A virtual device can call this service any number of times. Only the first call switches stacks; all subsequent calls increment a counter. If a virtual device locks the stack, it must eventually unlock it using the <B>End_Use_Locked_PM_Stack</B> service. </P>

<P>For Windows 95, the size of the protected-mode locked stack is 4K bytes. </P>
