<P class=proch><B><IMG SRC="../images/wedge.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>To run DCC over an IR link, carry out the following procedure</B>

<OL>
	<LI>Make sure the IR communications driver is properly installed and the IR devices are enabled by carrying out the procedures in <I>Step 1. Installing the IR Communications Driver</I> and <I>Step 2. Validating the IR Communications Driver Installation</I>. 
<P><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You might want to use the Limit Connection Speed To option on the Infrared Monitor Options tab to limit the IR connection speed to 9600 bps for the first test of DCC over the IR link (and then increase the speed later). 
</LI>

	<LI>On the host computer, click the Start button, point to Accessories, and then click Direct Cable Connection. </LI>

	<LI>Follow the steps in the Direct Cable Connection Wizard to set up the host computer. When the wizard prompts you, select the Host option. When the wizard prompts you to choose a port, use the same virtual port as you used in the procedure <I>Step 2. Validating the IR Communications Driver Installation</I> earlier in this documention. The wizard will also offer password protection. You do not need to establish password protection on the host for this test of the IR link. When you are done with the wizard, click the Finish button. DCC will start running on the IR link and display the message "Status: Waiting to connect via Serial cable on Com<I>x</I>," where Com<I>x</I> is the name of the virtual port the IR link is using. </LI>

	<LI>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the guest computer, except select the Guest option instead of the Host option. When you are done with the wizard, click the Finish button. The DCC connection is automatically made over the IR link, and all the shared folders on the host are displayed on the guest's screen. </LI>

	<LI>Working on the guest computer, to copy a shared folder from the host to the guest over the IR link select the folder's icon in the window that displays all the shared folders that are on the host and drag the icon to the desktop. To work on a shared folder on the host without copying it to the guest, double-click on the folder in the display on the guest. Note that if the host is connected to a network, the guest can reach shared resources on the network through the DCC connection to the host. </LI>
