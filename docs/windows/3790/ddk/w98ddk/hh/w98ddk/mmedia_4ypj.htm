<P>Installable compressors are not necessarily limited to video data. By using a different value than 'vidc' in the <B>fccType</B> member, you can specify that your installable driver expects to handle a type of data that is not video. (Four-character codes for non-video data should also be registered. For information about registering four-character codes, see . </P>

<P>While VidEdit does not support data that is not audio or video, MCIAVI does provide limited support for other data types using installable renderers. If you create a stream with a four-character code type that does not represent audio or video, its type and handler information will be used to search for a driver capable of handling the data. The search will follow the same procedure used for installable compressor drivers. </P>

<P>Writing a driver to render non-video data is very similar to rendering video, with the following differences: 

<UL>
	<LI>The format used is not a BITMAPINFO structure. The format is defined by the class of decompressor. </LI>

	<LI>The ICM_DECOMPRESS messages are not used. All data is rendered using the ICM_DRAW messages because there is no defined decompressed form for arbitrary data. </LI>
</UL>
