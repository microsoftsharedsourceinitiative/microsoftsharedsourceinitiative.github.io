<P>The only required vendor-supplied component is the high-level printer driver, which is layered above the spooler. A vendor can optionally supply a language monitor that is layered between the spooler and Usbmon.dll (for USB) or Localmon.dll (for parallel port). </P>

<P>This figure shows a vendor-supplied kernel-mode USB print driver (labeled IHV-supplied USB Print Driver) that is layered above the USB driver stack, which consists of Usbhub.sys, Usbd.sys, and some layers underneath. In the past, a vendor-supplied USB print driver was needed for USB printing on Windows 98 operating systems, which did not include an in-box kernel-mode USB print driver. </P>

<P>Printer vendors can now redistribute the Microsoft-supplied USB print driver and port monitor, Usbprint.sys and Usbmon.dll, for installation on Windows 98 systems. Microsoft is encouraging vendors to redistribute Usbprint.sys and Usbmon.dll rather than writing their own USB print drivers and port monitors. </P>
