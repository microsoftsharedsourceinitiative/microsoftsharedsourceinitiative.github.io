<P>You can start the System Debugger as an application from the real-mode command line or as a virtual device driver by specifying it in the SYSTEM.INI file. Before you start, however, you prepare for debugging by carrying out these steps: 

<UL>
	<LI>Connect a serial terminal or other computer by serial cable to a serial port on your debugging computer. </LI>

	<LI>Create symbol files for the applications, DLLs, and VxDs you intended to debug (see Creating Symbol Files). </LI>

	<LI>Install the system debug environment if available (see Installing Debug Environment). These are debugging versions of the system DLLs and VxDs and their symbol files that can make debugging easier. These files are available in the Windows 95 Device Driver Development Kit. </LI>
</UL>
