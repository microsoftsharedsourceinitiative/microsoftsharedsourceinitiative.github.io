<P>Windows® 95 printer drivers manage all printer output for applications. For an overview of Windows 95 printer drivers, see <I>About Windows 95 Printer Drivers </I>. </P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You should develop a Windows printer driver only if the Unidriver does not support your printing device. If the Unidriver does support your device, you should use the UniTool application to develop a printer minidriver. For more information about the Unidriver, the UniTool application, and printer minidrivers, see <I>About Printer Minidrivers</I>. </P>

<P>If you are developing an advanced, next-generation printer, which is incompatible with the Windows 95 Unidriver or PSCRIPT.DRV, DESKJETC.DRV, or HPPLOT.DRV, then you will have to create a printer driver that fully implements all of the functions required by GDI. Documentation for doing this will be provided on the MSDN CD-ROM after initial shipment of the Windows 95 DDK. Some guidelines for developing a complete printer driver (instead of developing a minidriver that works with the Windows 95 Unidriver) are given in <I>About Windows 95 Printer Drivers </I>. </P>

<P>The printer driver functions and structures that are new for Windows 95, or are significantly modified, are listed in the table below. </P>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=41%><B>DeviceCapabilties</B> </TD>
<TD width=27%>Retrieves the capabilities of the printer device driver. </TD>
<TD width=32%>Windows 3.x drivers running under Windows 95 are strongly encouraged to export the <B>DeviceCapabilities</B> function. Printer drivers written to take advantage of the new Windows 95 printer support must export the <B>DeviceCapabilities</B> function. See the Windows 3.1 DDK "Device Driver Adaptation Guide" for a definition of the <B>DeviceCapabilities</B> function. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=41%><B>DEVMODE structure</B> </TD>
<TD width=27%>Structure that contains information about the device initialization and environment of a printer. Applications pass this structure to <B>ExtDeviceMode</B> and <B>DeviceCapabilities</B> functions exported by a printer driver. </TD>
<TD width=32%>About a dozen new members have been added to the <B>DEVMODE</B> structure to support the new Windows 95 printer support. See <I>New Function and Structure Reference</I> for more information. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=41%><B>DrvGetPrinterData</B> </TD>
<TD width=27%>Retrieves printer driver information from the registry. Typically used to initialize the <B>DEVMODE</B> structure. </TD>
<TD width=32%>See <I>New Function and Structure Reference</I> for more information. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=41%><B>DrvSetPrinterData</B> </TD>
<TD width=27%>Stores data from the extended <B>DEVMODE</B> structure in the registry. </TD>
<TD width=32%>See <I>New Function and Structure Reference</I> for more information. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=41%><B>ExtDeviceMode</B> </TD>
<TD width=27%>Retrieves or changes device-initialization information for a given driver, or displays a driver-supplied dialog box for configuring the driver. Applications call <B>ExtDeviceMode</B> when the user requests setting up the printer as part of preparing for a print job. </TD>
<TD width=32%>Windows 3.x drivers running under Windows 95 are strongly encouraged to export the <B>ExtDeviceMode</B> function. Printer drivers written to take advantage of the new Windows 95 printer support must export the <B>ExtDeviceMode</B> function. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=41%><B>ExtDeviceModePropSheet</B> </TD>
<TD width=27%>Presents a property sheet to the user for controlling the attributes of a printer. </TD>
<TD width=32%>See <I>New Function and Structure Reference</I> for more information. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=41%><B>ExtTextOut</B> </TD>
<TD width=27%>Writes text strings by converting characters in a given string into raster, vector, or outline glyphs and copies the glyphs to the given device or bit map. </TD>
<TD width=32%>For Windows 95, changes have been made to the 16-bit <B>ExtTextOut</B> function exported by GDI. These changes enable printer drivers to more easily support True Type fonts non-Windows ANSI character sets and True Type fonts using character sets with more than 256 characters. </TD>
