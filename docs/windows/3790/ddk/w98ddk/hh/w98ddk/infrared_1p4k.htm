<P>DCC is not installed with the typical Windows 95 installation recommended for most computers. </P>

<P>So you must check whether DCC is installed on both of the two computers that will be using the IR link. To do this, click the Start button, point to Programs, and then point to Accessories. Direct Cable Connection appears in this menu of it is installed on the computer you are checking. </P>

<P>If you find that DCC is installed on the host and DCC is installed on the guest, then you can skip the next step. </P>
