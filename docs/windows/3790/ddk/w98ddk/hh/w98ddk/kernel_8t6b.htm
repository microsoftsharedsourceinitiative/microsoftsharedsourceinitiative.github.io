<H2><A NAME="_pss_1123"></A>Hook procedures</H2>

<P>Windows 95 provides additional services that allow a virtual device to unhook various services that it had previously hooked. This has become increasingly important with the introduction of dynamically-loaded VxDs. In order to support this feature, new requirements have been imposed on VxDs which hook device services or faults. </P>

<P>The hook procedure passed in the ESI register to <B>Hook_Device_Service</B>, <B>Hook_V86_Fault</B>, <B>Hook_PM_Fault</B>, and <B>Hook_VMM_Fault</B> must be one declared with the BeginProc macro (defined in vmm.h) with the HOOK_PROC attribute. You are required to pass a new-style hook procedure even if you never plan to unhook the service. Failure to comply will prevent other devices from unhooking the service. Windows 95 supports old-style hook procedures solely for backwards-compatibility. Support for old-style hook procedures may be removed in a future version of Windows, so it is imperative that you convert all your hook procedures to the new style when building for Windows 95. (New-style hook procedures are downward-compatible with Windows 3.1, so there is no loss of amenity there.) </P>

<P>Here is a sample hook procedure, and the code that installs and removes it. </P>

<PRE>VxD_LOCKED_DATA_SEG
pPrevHook dd 0
VxD_LOCKED_DATA_ENDS

BeginProc MyHook, HOOK_PROC, pPrevHook, LOCKED

    pushfd                  ; Remember, hooks must preserve all regs
    pushad                  ;
    Trace_Out  "An MS-DOS app is starting"
    popad
    popfd
    jmp        [pPrevHook]  ; Chain to previous hook

EndProc MyHook

    ...
    ; Install the hook to watch for MS-DOS apps starting
    mov      esi, offset32 MyHook
    GetVxDServiceOrdinal eax, DOSMGR_Begin_V86_App
    VMMCall  Hook_Device_Service
    jc       Error
IFDEF    WIN31COMPAT
    mov  pPrevHook, esi    ; Windows 3.1 requires this
                           ; Optional in Windows 95 provided
                           ; MyHook is a HOOK_PROC
ENDIF

    ...
    ; Remove the hook that watches for MS-DOS apps starting
    mov      esi, offset32 MyHook
    GetVxDServiceOrdinal eax, DOSMGR_Begin_V86_App
    VMMCall  Unhook_Device_Service
    jc       Error
 </PRE>

<P>Observe that the value returned in ESI need not be stored into pPrevHook under Windows 95; the VMM automatically does this. (This also closes race conditions that occur if you hook an asynchronous service and a hardware interrupt arrives before you can save the answer.) Moreover, you should never attempt to modify the value in pPrevHook yourself; VMM assumes that it is the only code which will modify the value, because it uses that value to walk the hook chain. Furthermore, you must never attempt to 'unhook' the service by passing pPrevHook as the ESI to a <B>Hook_Device_Service</B> or <B>Hook_XX_Fault</B> call, for that too will mess up the bookkeeping. </P>

<P>For fault hooks, there is another twist. If there was no previous fault hook, zero is returned in ESI, for compatibility with Windows 3.1, but the address of the system default fault handler is returned in pPrevHook anyway. This allows you to pass a fault through instead of being forced to handle it. Sample code to install the hook procedure would then look like </P>

<PRE>    mov      esi, offset32 MyHook
    mov      eax, 6            ; Invalid opcode fault
    VMMCall  Hook_VMM_Fault
    jc       Error
IFDEF    WIN31COMPAT
    mov      pPrevHook, esi    ; DO NOT DO THIS FOR WINDOWS 95
ENDIF
 </PRE>

<P>The hook itself would look like this </P>

<PRE>BeginProc MyHook, HOOK_PROC, pPrevHook, LOCKED

    pushfd                    ; Remember, hooks must preserve all regs
    pushad                    ;
    Trace_Out  "An invalid opcode fault"
    popad
IFDEF  WIN31COMPAT            ; THIS IS NOT NECESSARY FOR WINDOWS 95
    cmp        [pPrevHook], 0 ; Was there a previous hook
    jnz        @F             ; Yes, chain to it
    popfd                     ; No, just return (nothing better to do)
    retd
@@:
ENDIF
    popfd
    jmp    [pPrevHook]        ; Chain to previous hook

EndProc MyHook
 </PRE>

<P>Observe how the Windows 95 hook mechanism removes the need to alter behavior depending on whether there was a previous fault handler. </P>
