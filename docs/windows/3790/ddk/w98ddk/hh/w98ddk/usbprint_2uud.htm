<P>This section provides answers to some frequently asked questions about USB printer installation. 

<DL>
<DT><B>Q: If a user has installed my company's USB printing solution for Windows Me, what happens if a second vendor's solution tries to load? </B></DT>

<DD>A: The two solutions might conflict with each other and interfere with successful printing on the user's system. The operating system cannot detect or prevent such conflicts. It is recommended that vendors use the Microsoft USB printing solution. </DD>

<DT><B>Q: If my company supplies a top-to-bottom USB printing solution for Windows 98 and Windows Me, what is the mechanism for upgrading to the Microsoft USB printing solution? </B></DT>

<DD>A: Uninstall the vendor-supplied solution completely and then install the Microsoft solution. It should be possible for an update program to uninstall the vendor-supplied solution transparently, without requiring specific action on the part of the user. However, it is recommended that an update include instructions in case the user wants to perform these steps manually. </DD>

<DT><B>Q: If my company wants to use the Microsoft USB printing solution for Windows 98, what is the process for redistributing those files? </B></DT>

<DD>A: Contact Microsoft at USBWinPrint@microsoft.com for information about redistributing these files. </DD>

<DT><B>Q: My company has a USB printing solution for Windows Me. What is the process for driver signing? What files do I have to submit? </B></DT>

<DD>A: Submit your entire driver package to WHQL for testing and digital signature, as described at: http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/desinit/digitsign.htm </DD>

<DT><B>Q: If my company uses the Microsoft USB printing solution for Windows 98, what happens when the user upgrades to Windows Me or Windows 2000? </B></DT>

<DD>A: The printer will continue to work. The user will not have to reinstall the printer after upgrading. </DD>

<DT><B>Q: If my company wants to redistribute Usbprint.sys and Usbmon.dll for Windows 98, do I have to resubmit the driver package to WHQL for testing? </B></DT>

<DD>A driver's digital signature is generated from the complete set of binaries in the driver package. Adding files or changing existing files in the package invalidates the existing digital signature. The driver package must be resubmitted to WHQL for testing and a new digital signature.
