<P>SCSI miniport drivers are HBA-specific but OS-independent. That is, each miniport driver links itself against the SCSI port driver and calls only the port driver's <B>ScsiPort</B><I>Xxx</I> routines to communicate with the system. HBA miniport drivers can be compiled to run on machines running Windows® 95 or Windows NT®/Windows® 2000. Each platform provides an OS-dependent port driver that exports the <B>ScsiPort</B><I>Xxx</I> routines. </P>

<P>Every SCSI miniport driver must have at least the following system-defined routines: 

<UL>
	<LI>DriverEntry to initialize the miniport driver </LI>

	<LI>HwFindAdapter to determine how (or whether) driver-supported HBA(s) are configured in the machine </LI>

	<LI>HwInitialize to initialize the HBA(s) </LI>

	<LI>HwStartIo to start operations on the HBA for an incoming request </LI>

	<LI>HwResetBus to handle bus-reset requests </LI>
</UL>

<P>Depending on the HBA and the driver designer, SCSI miniport drivers also can have any or all of the following system-defined routines: 

<UL>
	<LI>HwInterrupt to handle HBA-generated interrupts, which is optional if and only if the miniport manages all I/O operations on its HBA by polling </LI>
</UL>

<P>However, using polling exclusively has an adverse effect on a miniport's performance and on its HBA's I/O throughput. 

<UL>
	<LI>HwDmaStarted to set up an HBA transfer after the system DMA controller has been programmed by the port driver </LI>

	<LI>HwDisableInterruptsCallback and HwEnableInterruptsCallback to handle deferred I/O processing if a particular operation takes a long time </LI>

	<LI>HwTimer to time operations on the HBA that require long delays 
<P>A miniport should have a HwTimer routine if it has no HwInterrupt routine so it can use the HwTimer routine for efficient polling of the HBA. 
</LI>

	<LI>HwAdapterState, defined for compatibility with future MS-DOS versions </LI>
</UL>

<P>The following sections describe the requirements for and functionality of each of these miniport driver routines. For reference information about the services the SCSI port driver offers to a miniport driver, see <I>Introduction to SCSI Port Driver Services Reference</I>. </P>
