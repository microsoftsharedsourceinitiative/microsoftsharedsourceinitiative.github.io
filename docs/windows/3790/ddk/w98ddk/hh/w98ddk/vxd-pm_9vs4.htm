<P>The system sleep process proceeds exactly as described in <A HREF="vxd-pm_94kz.htm">System Sleep States and Device Drivers</A>. The configuration manager determines that the device supports wake up and uses low power states that support wake up. When going to sleep, a device driver that has wake up enabled should set any registers in its device that are needed to enable wake up in the hardware, and then put itself in the lowest power state that supports wake up. </P>

<P>Bus drivers that have a wake-up device enabled on their bus are themselves a wake-up device. They set themselves in the lowest power state that supports wake up. </P>

<P>In this manner, all the various device states required for enabled wake-up devices to wake the computer are set.</P>
