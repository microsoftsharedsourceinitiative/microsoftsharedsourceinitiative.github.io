<P>OnNow moves power management decision making from the basic input/output system (BIOS) into the operating system to allow for a greater degree of interoperability between the hardware and software. Display drivers need to be updated to support OnNow by responding to power state commands and by providing information on what power states are supported by the hardware device.</P>

<P>In Microsoft® Windows® 98, the virtual display driver (VDD) handles OnNow calls and passes them to the virtual display minidriver (miniVDD). The miniVDD handles the mechanics of saving and restoring state in the hardware during power transitions. If the miniVDD does not hook up to any of the OnNow functions (in the case of legacy drivers), the VDD makes Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) calls.</P>

<P>Four states, which roughly correspond to the VESA states, can be supported by display hardware. These are as follows.</P>

<P>In Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) hardware, the physical removal of power is handled entirely by ACPI. </P>

<P>In Advanced Power Management (APM) controlled hardware, the removal of power is handled by the APM BIOS.</P>

<P>In desktop computers, power can still be removed from the display hardware if the computer is able to hibernate (save memory to disk and power off).</P>

<P>In all cases, the miniVDD does not need to do anything to physically alter the power consumption of the hardware. However, if the display hardware supports some form of power conservation that cannot be controlled by either of the above methods, the miniVDD can touch the hardware directly to reduce power consumption.</P>

<P>All hardware, regardless of ACPI or APM, will re-POST the device during a boot or when resuming from a hibernate state. When returning to the DO state on machines that can hibernate, the display driver must redo any initialization that happens after the power-on self test (POST)</P>

<P>Power transitions occur only between D0 and other states. In other words, there are no transitions between D1, D2, and D3. </P>

<P>The following occurs during power transitions:

<UL>
	<LI>For the primary (VGA) device, an INT 2F AX=4001 interrupt is sent when powering down; Windows sets text mode. When a wake-up event occurs, an INT 2F AX=4002 interrupt is sent; the driver internally calls <B>ResetHiResMode</B>. The operating system then repaints the screen.</LI>

	<LI>For secondary displays (not the primary VGA), the operating system calls <B>Disable</B> when powering down and it calls <B>Enable</B> when powering up. The operating system then repaints the screen.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a driver passes the "Magic School Bus" test in the Display Compatibility Test (DCT), then it works correctly.</P>
