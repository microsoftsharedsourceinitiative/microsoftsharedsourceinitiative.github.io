<P>A volume EJECT command can be generated either by an application, the Shell, or by the hardware when the user pushes the eject button. </P>

<P>The volume tracker will issue an INT 15 broadcast for every EJECT command it receives. If INT 15 is returned with a status that suggests that EJECT should not proceed, the command will not be sent to the hardware. </P>

<P>If the INT 15 broadcast is returned without error, the volume tracker will call every FSD that has mounted this media. FSDs are expected to flush their dirty buffers and issue unlocks in response to this request. </P>

<P>After all FSDs have flushed their buffers and have unlocked the volume, the volume tracker will make sure that the depth counter is zero before sending the EJECT command to the hardware. </P>

<P>If depth counter is still nonzero, the volume tracker will pop-up a warning message and will ask the user whether he wishes to continue with the EJECT request. If asked to continue, the volume tracker will issue unlock command and eject the volume. </P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;INT 13 extensions and INT 15 eject broadcast commands are described in detail in a separate document. </P>
