<P>The Microsoft® DirectX® application programming interface (API) is a component of the Software Development Kit (SDK) that enables the creation of world class computer-based games. DirectSound® is the audio component of that SDK that provides low-latency mixing, hardware acceleration, and direct access to the sound device. DirectSound provides this functionality while maintaining compatibility with existing Microsoft Windows® 95 applications and device drivers. </P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The information contained in this document describes how to modify your audio driver to support DirectSound capabilities in Windows 95. It is included for backward compatibility. Although Windows 98 supports Windows 95-style drivers with DirectSound enhancements, new driver development should be done under the WDM audio driver model. For more information, see the WDM audio driver model supplied with the <I>Windows 98 DDK</I> and the <I>Windows NT DDK</I>.</P>
