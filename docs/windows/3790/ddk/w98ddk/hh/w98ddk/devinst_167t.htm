<P>This section describes how multifunction devices get installed and configured by the Windows® 95 Plug and Play architecture. Multifunction devices are physical devices which incorporate multiple logical devices. For example a board incorporating a SCSI controller and a sound chip is considered a multifunction device, a DSP board that can behave as a modem, a sound device or both is considered a multifunction device as well. </P>

<P>The following devices/scenarios are covered: 

<UL>
	<LI>PNP - Multiple logical devices on a single board consuming nonoverlapping resources. (Resources refers to use of IRQs, I/O ranges, memory ranges, or DMA channels.) </LI>

	<LI>PNP - Multiple logical devices on a single board consuming overlapping resources </LI>

	<LI>PNP - Multiple devices incorporated in a parent/daughter card configuration </LI>

	<LI>PNP - Multiple devices incorporated in a master/slave configuration via a proprietary bus </LI>

	<LI>PNP - A multipersonality board (for example, a DSP with multiple functions but only one available at a time) </LI>

	<LI>Legacy multifunction devices </LI>
</UL>

<P>This section assumes that the reader is familiar with the Windows® 95 Plug and Play architecture and the relevant sections in the Windows 95 Device Driver Development Kit (DDK). One of the most important aspects of installing and configuring a multifunction card is having a proper INF file. The Beta 2 INF format has been extended to support the different flavors of multifunction cards. Sample INF files are included in this documentation. </P>
