<H4>Members</H4>

<DL>
<DT><B>dwFlags</B> </DT>

<DD>Flags describing certain capabilities of the device. The driver should set all applicable flags. 

<DL>
<DT>DSCAPS_CONTINUOUSRATE </DT>

<DD>Supports all sample rates between the <B>dwMinSecondarySampleRate</B> and <B>dwMaxSecondarySampleRate</B> values. Typically this means that the actual output rate will be within +/- 10Hz of the requested frequency. </DD>

<DT>DSCAPS_PRIMARYMONO </DT>

<DD>The device supports monophonic primary buffers. </DD>

<DT>DSCAPS_PRIMARYSTEREO </DT>

<DD>The device supports stereo primary buffers. </DD>

<DT>DSCAPS_PRIMARY8BIT </DT>

<DD>The device supports primary buffers with 8-bit samples. </DD>

<DT>DSCAPS_PRIMARY16BIT </DT>

<DD>The device supports primary sound buffers with 16-bit samples. </DD>

<DT>DSCAPS_SECONDARYMONO </DT>

<DD>The device supports hardware-mixed monophonic secondary buffers. </DD>

<DT>DSCAPS_SECONDARYSTEREO </DT>

<DD>The device supports hardware-mixed stereo secondary buffers. </DD>

<DT>DSCAPS_SECONDARY8BIT </DT>

<DD>The device supports hardware-mixed secondary buffers with 8-bit samples. </DD>

<DT>DSCAPS_SECONDARY16BIT </DT>

<DD>The device supports hardware-mixed secondary sound buffers with 16-bit samples. </DD>
</DL>
</DD>

<DT><B>dwMinSecondarySampleRate</B> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the minimum sample rate supported by this device's secondary sound buffers. </DD>

<DT><B>dwMaxSecondarySampleRate</B> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the maximum sample rate supported by this device's secondary sound buffers. </DD>

<DT><B>dwPrimaryBuffers</B> </DT>

<DD>Number of primary buffers supported. The driver must always set this value to 1 for this release. </DD>

<DT><B>dwMaxHwMixingAllBuffers</B> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the total number of buffers that can be mixed in hardware. This member, along with the <B>dwMaxHwMixingStaticBuffers</B> and <B>dwMaxHwMixingStreamingBuffers </B>members, describe the hardware mixing capabilities of the device. This member can be less than the sum of <B>dwMaxHwMixingStaticBuffers</B> and <B>dwMaxHwMixingStreamingBuffers</B>, as there are usually some resource trade-offs. </DD>

<DT><B>dwMaxHwMixingStaticBuffers</B> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the maximum number of static buffers (that is, buffers located in on-board sound memory). </DD>

<DT><B>dwMaxHwMixingStreamingBuffers</B> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the maximum number of streaming buffers. </DD>

<DT><B>dwFreeHwMixingAllBuffers</B>, <B>dwFreeHwMixingStaticBuffers</B>, and <B>dwFreeHwMixingStreamingBuffers</B> </DT>

<DD>Describe the free (unallocated) hardware mixing capabilities of the device. An application can use these values to determine whether hardware resources are available for allocation to a secondary sound buffer. Also, by comparing these values to <B>dwMaxHwMixingAllBuffers</B>, <B>dwMaxHwMixingStaticBuffers</B>, and <B>dwMaxHwMixingStreamingBuffers</B>, the resources that are already allocated can be determined. </DD>

<DT><B>dwMaxHw3DAllBuffers</B>, <B>dwMaxHw3DStaticBuffers</B>, and <B>dwMaxHw3DStreamingBuffers</B> </DT>

<DD>Describe the hardware 3-D positional capabilities of the device. </DD>

<DT><B>dwFreeHw3DAllBuffers</B>, <B>dwFreeHw3DStaticBuffers</B>, and <B>dwFreeHw3DStreamingBuffers</B> </DT>

<DD>Describe the free (unallocated) hardware 3-D positional capabilities of the device. </DD>

<DT><B>dwTotalHwMemBytes</B> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the total amount of hardware memory (in bytes) that stores static sound buffers on the card itself. </DD>

<DT><B>dwFreeHwMemBytes</B> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the total amount of free memory. </DD>

<DT><B>dwMaxContigFreeHwMemBytes</B> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the maximum contiguous block of free memory (that is, the largest buffer that can currently be allocated). 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>If the device has no onboard sound memory, the driver should set the <B>dwTotalHwMemBytes</B>, <B>dwFreeHwMemBytes</B>, and <B>dwMaxContigFreeHwMemBytes</B> members to zero. If the driver is managing the heap itself, it should fill in these members correctly. Otherwise, either DirectSound or DirectDraw® is managing the heap, so DirectSound fills in these members on the driver's behalf. </P>
