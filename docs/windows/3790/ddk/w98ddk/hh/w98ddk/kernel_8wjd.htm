<P>Marks pages as not recently accessed, making them more likely page-out candidates. The pages can optionally be marked discarded as well, which reverts them to an unaltered state, avoiding the need even to page them out. Uses EAX, ECX, EDX, and Flags. </P>

<P>Returns a nonzero value in the EAX register if successful, zero otherwise.

<DD>Linear page number of the first page to mark as page-out candidates. All pages of the specified range must be committed. If the pages are associated with a virtual machine, they must be marked V86Pageable. </DD>

<DD>Handle of the virtual machine containing the pages to mark as page-out candidates. This parameter is required if the <I>Page</I> parameter is less than 110h; otherwise it is ignored. </DD>

<P>It is an error to attempt to discard pages that are not committed. This service ignores pages that are not present (that is, already paged out) or are locked (and cannot be paged out). This service affects only pages that are subject to demand paging. </P>

<P>The PAGEDISCARD flag causes the system to revert the pages to their unaltered state as well as removing the pages from memory. The PAGEZEROINIT flag may only be passed for pages that were originally allocated as normal swappable memory, either uninitialized or zero-initialized; that is, PD_ZEROINIT or PD_NOINIT. It is an error to attempt to PAGEZEROINIT pages that belong to any other type of pager (because they won't know what to do). </P>
