<P>WMI data is organized into components (typically one per device driver), each of which may have multiple sets of data items. A set of data items is referred to as a data block. Each data block is assigned a unique GUID that is the mechanism by which WMI distinguishes blocks. Individual data items within a block are identified by a data item ID that is unique within the block. </P>

<P>A data provider can provide zero or more instances of a data block. An instance of a data block is a separate set of data items for the identical block. For example, a network driver might provide a standard block of data and could provide two instances of it: one instance for connection1 and one for connection2. Multiple data providers can also supply different instances of the same data block, particularly in the case of a standard data block. Therefore, each data provider is assigned a provider ID that WMI uses to distinguish the different data providers. A driver should use the pointer to its device object as its provider ID. </P>

<P>All instances of a data block have an instance name. Instance names for data blocks that are represented by the same GUID must be unique. Data providers should register data blocks whose instance names are static or slow changing as a static instance name data block. If a data block is not registered as a static instance name data block, then it is registered as a dynamic instance name data block.</P>

<P>Data blocks can contain both data and event items. A data item is a dynamic value that can be one of the following types: 32-bit integer, 64-bit integer, Unicode string, octet string (buffer of BYTE), timestamp (LARGE_INTEGER or string based), or an array of the preceding types. Unicode strings (or WCHAR arrays) are always preceded by a USHORT value that contains the count of characters in the string. These strings do not need to be NULL terminated and the count does not include any NULL terminator. </P>

<P>The LARGE_INTEGER timestamp format is in units of 100 nanoseconds since January 1, 1601. The string-based timestamp format is a fixed format string that specifies an exact date and time or interval. Data items may be read-only and the device driver must ensure that they are not overwritten because WMI does not enforce read-only attributes for specific data items. </P>

<P>WMI makes no assumptions about the contents of the data item other than its size. An event item is identical to a data item with the exception that a data provider can also push the changed value of the event item back to any data consumer that registered for the notification change, while a data item is only polled for by a data consumer.</P>

<P>WMI forwards queries and changes to data providers in WDM device drivers using IRPs. Data consumers assume that each call will return consistent data. For example, a request for multiple data items or multiple instances must return consistent information; the sum over all instances of % processor time should be N*100, where N is the number of processors. Data consumers also expect that requests to device drivers be completed with minimal overhead because performance monitors may be sampling the data items. Data providers should only provide raw data values and leave it to the data consumers to perform any calculations.</P>
