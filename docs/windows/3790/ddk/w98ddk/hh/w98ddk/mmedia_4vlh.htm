<P>Some waveform-audio devices may support wave formats other than PCM formats. For example, the hardare may allow direct playback or recording of a compressed format, such as IMAADPCM or alaw. In this case, the ACM does not have to send the data to an ACM driver once for conversion and then again to the wave driver for playback. Instead the compressed data is sent directly to the wave driver. </P>

<P>If a wave device supports compressed formats, the manufacturer may choose to provide a corresponding ACM driver that supports partial ACM functionality for enumerating formats. This ACM driver would not provide support for compression or decompression, but would instead allow the ACM to recognize that the compressed formats are supported by the wave device. This would allow users of the ACM to recognize that the compressed formats are supported directly by the wave device. The ACM driver messages that should be supported by such a driver are as follows: 

<UL>
	<LI>ACMDM_DRIVER_DETAILS </LI>

	<LI>ACMDM_FORMAT_DETAILS </LI>

	<LI>ACMDM_FORMATTAG_DETAILS </LI>

	<LI>ACMDM_HARDWARE_WAVE_CAPS_INPUT </LI>

	<LI>ACMDM_HARDWARE_WAVE_CAPS_OUTPUT </LI>

	<LI>DRV_CLOSE </LI>

	<LI>DRV_FREE </LI>

	<LI>DRV_LOAD </LI>

	<LI>DRV_OPEN </LI>
</UL>

<P>The ACM driver can use the ACMDRIVERDETAILS_SUPPORTF_HARDWARE support flag to specify that the format is available for playback, recording, or both. This means that no stream-based operations can be performed. (The ACMDRIVERDETAILS_SUPPORTF_HARDWARE flag is specified in the <B>fdwSupport</B> member of the <B>ACMDRIVERDETAILS</B> structure.) </P>

<P>Some waveform-audio devices may also allow compression or decompression of audio data without requiring that the data be played back or recorded. In other words, it is possible to send data to the device to be compressed but not played. The compressed data can then be read back from the device. This is very similar to a hardware-supported ACM driver. The difference is that the hardware is shared between the wave driver and the ACM driver. </P>

<P>In this case, the wave device manufacturer should provide a VxD (just as for a wave driver or a hardware-supported ACM driver). The manufacturer also provides both a wave driver and an ACM driver (both DLLs). Both the wave driver and the ACM driver communicate with the VxD to allocate the hardware and perform any hardware access. The VxD is responsible for arbitrating hardware access between the wave driver and the ACM driver. </P>
