<P>A character-translation table is used by Microsoft Windows and the Microsoft Windows Universal Printer Driver to remap characters from the printer's native character and symbol set to the Windows ANSI set. The Universal Printer Driver will provide support for some of the common code pages and symbol sets, so that this data will not need to be redundant in a large number of individual printer drivers. It is intended that printer drivers supporting devices with less common code pages and symbol sets will contain their own character-translation table resources. Any given driver can mix and match either of these types of character-translation tables as needed. Character-translation tables provided by the Universal Printer Driver are referenced from the minidriver through negative numbers that correspond to the resource ID values (from the Universal Printer Driver), and character-translation tables provided by the minidriver are referenced by positive numbers corresponding to the resource ID values (from the minidriver).</P>
