<P>In Windows 95, several functions have been added both to the real-mode VxD loader and to the Virtual Machine Manager to allow VxDs full access to the registry during initialization and during normal run time. Many of the standard Win32 and 16-bit registry access functions are also supported. </P>

<P>In most cases, VxDs can write to the registry in protected mode. However, VxDs cannot write to the registry during the real-mode initialization phase, nor can they gain access to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER key until following the Init_Complete phase. </P>
