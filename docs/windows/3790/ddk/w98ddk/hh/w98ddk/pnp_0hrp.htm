<P>The Windows 95 support of PCMCIA provides the Card Services 2.<I>x</I> level of functionality. This is integrated with the Windows 95 Plug and Play architecture so that Configuration Manager provides the resource allocation instead of the Card Services module. This is done by adding a PCMCIA bus enumerator to Card Services and changing Card Services to accept configurations from Configuration Manager instead of tracking the resources itself. This implementation provides support for existing PCMCIA Card Services clients as well as new Plug and Play drivers on Windows 95. </P>

<P>The following diagram is an expanded illustration of the architecture of PCMCIA in Windows 95. </P>
