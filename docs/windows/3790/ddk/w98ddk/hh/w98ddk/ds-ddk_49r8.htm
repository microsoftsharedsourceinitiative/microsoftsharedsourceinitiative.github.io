<P>Windows 95 DirectSound audio drivers can support 3-D audio acceleration by supporting the interfaces described in this document. The Windows 95 implementation of DirectSound accesses these interfaces to accelerate 3-D audio virtualization. Similar interfaces will be used in the future WDM audio port/miniport driver architecture, which is currently in design. Thus, development of these interfaces can be leveraged in the new driver architecture as well. </P>

<P>Current DirectSound drivers for Windows 95 support two classes of logical objects within the driver. These can be referred to as the DsDriver object and DsDriverBuffer object. These are the driver objects that support the <B>IDsDriver</B> and <B>IDsDriverBuffer</B> interfaces accessed by DirectSound. </P>

<P>A new interface, <B>IDsDriverPropertySet</B>, is defined in this document. This interface is a generic mechanism allowing drivers to extend DirectSound objects with new object properties. This interface is implemented by the driver developer on the driver objects mentioned above. Since the 3-D parameters of DirectSound can be viewed as properties, this new interface also serves well for passing 3-D parameters to the driver to accelerate DirectSound3D. </P>

<P>A similar interface, <B>IKsPropertySet</B>, is implemented in the DirectSound API on DirectSoundBuffer objects. When an application accesses the <B>IKsPropertySet</B> interface, DirectSound forwards those calls to the driver through the <B>IDsDriverPropertySet</B> interface. This is the mechanism by which a hardware manufacturer can provide vendor-specific extensions to the product. </P>
