<P>An FSD that emulates a character device registers with the IFS manager by calling this service. If the version number passed in matches, the FSD will be registered for the list of character devices it requests for. Whenever a file system call is made to the character device name, the appropriate FSD will be called on its function entry points.

<DD>Supplies a pointer to the FSD mount entry point. (FS_MountVolume) </DD>

<DD>Supplies the version of the IFS manager that the FSD can support. </DD>

<DT><I>ppDeviceNames</I> </DT>

<DD>Supplies a pointer to a set of pointers to Unicode device name strings that need to be registered as character devices with the IFS manager. The list of pointers to device name strings is terminated by a NULL. There has to be at least one device name pointer. Each device name string is in Unicode and has the format of a <B>PathElement</B> structure that has already been described in Section 8.3.1. </DD>
