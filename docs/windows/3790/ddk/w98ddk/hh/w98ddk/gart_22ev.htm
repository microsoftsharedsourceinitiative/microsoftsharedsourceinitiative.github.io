<P>Modern 3D graphics processing on PCs requires fast processing of texture maps by both the host processor and the graphics device. After the CPU performs transformations on a texture, the data must travel across the bus to the graphics controller for display. For animation, these textures are continuously being updated by the host processor and the transmission of large data blocks across a slow bus is time consuming. </P>

<P>Intel's new accelerated graphics processor (AGP) architecture provides fast access by the graphics device to system memory, enabling data common to the graphic and host processors to be stored in host memory. Thus, AGP allows textures to be accessed directly from system memory during rendering rather than being prefetched to local graphics memory.</P>

<P>The AGP bus improves system performance in several ways. First, the AGP channel between system memory and the graphics device operates at 66Mhz, twice the PCI standard of 33MHz. In addition, the AGP bus operates independently of other busses in the system, providing bus-level parallelism.</P>

<P>Because of host paging, blocks of memory with contiguous linear addresses may not be contiguous physically. However, the graphics device must see data structures such as texture maps as a contiguous block. To solve this problem, AGP hardware is equipped with core logic to translate addresses through a memory-based graphics address remapping table, or GART. The GART performs a mapping function similar to the host's paging tables, but the two mechanisms are independent and should not be confused. This address remapping applies only to a single, programmable range of the system physical address space, as shown in the following diagram. Only addresses within the GART's aperture have the mapping applied; other addresses are passed through unchanged.</P>

<P>The format of the GART is unspecified and left to the hardware designer. For the latest AGP hardware specification, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=8723&clcid=0x409" target="_blank">Intel AGP technology</A> Web site.</P>
