<TD width=54%><B>Defining Display Adapters</B>
<P>All display adapters must be connected to the PCI bus, since each accelerator’s VGA resources are controlled exclusively. The display adapters are divided into the following two main categories:</P>
</TD>
<TD width=46%>Same specification as AT machines.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=54%><B>Primary Display Adapter</B>
<P>This display adapter is the only one that has the VGA resource that enables startup/shutdown screen and full-screen command prompt display (MS-DOS mode) in addition to the graphical user interface (GUI) display.</P>
</TD>
<TD width=46%>Previously provided (desktop GUI display, startup/shutdown screen display, and full-screen MS-DOS prompt) display functions are available (see , <A HREF="nec98mm_5iuq.htm">PC-9801/9821-Series Display Adapter</A>).</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=54%><B>Secondary Display Adapter</B>
<P>This display adapter is one that does not have any VGA resources other than for the primary display adapter that only displays GUI.</P>

<P>The secondary display adapter supports up to eight devices. With the addition of the primary display adapter, it supports up to nine devices.</P>
</TD>
<TD width=46%>The Core Graph is used for full-screen command prompt for the primary display adapter. Therefore, it will not become the secondary display adapter because it is always a part of the primary display adapter. (see , <A HREF="nec98mm_4oqa.htm">Secondary Display Adapter</A>).</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=54%><B>Determining the Primary Display Adapter</B>
<P>Plug and Play BIOS differentiates the primary and secondary display adapters. That is, it assigns the VGA resources. The operating system is not involved in this process. Generally, the display adapter on the motherboard becomes the secondary display adapter when another display card is added. In some cases, however, the adapter may be unusable because it has become disconnected, or because ROM access has been denied (depending on the motherboard and BIOS).</P>
</TD>
<TD width=46%>Register which display adapter is the primary in the registry. See <A HREF="nec98mm_6v5e.htm">Determining the Primary Display Adapter</A>.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=54%><B>Display Driver</B>
<P>A compatible display driver for the secondary display adapter is necessary to use the multimonitor feature.</P>
</TD>
<TD width=46%>To use the multimonitor feature, the display driver must be primary/secondary compatible (see <A HREF="nec98mm_4o1e.htm">Display Driver</A>).</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=54%><B>Primary</B>
<P>The current display driver for Windows 95 may be used. If a Windows 3.1 driver or a VGA driver is used, the multimonitor feature cannot be utilized even if another secondary display adapter exists.</P>
</TD>
<TD width=46%>The current display driver for Windows 95 cannot be used as a primary display adapter.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=54%><B>Secondary</B>
<P>A compatible display driver is necessary to use the secondary display adapter.</P>
</TD>
<TD width=46%>Same specification as AT machines.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=54%><B>Operation When Several Identical Boards are Installed</B>
<P>By default, a single instance of a driver is loaded  for each adapter in the system, even if a board has the same display adapter and the same chip set installed. However, it is possible to program it to load the driver for every instance of the device in order to make it operate in a single instance.</P>
</TD>
<TD width=46%>Same specification as AT machines.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=54%> <B>Accessing the Adapter from the Driver</B>
<P>Control the PCI setting from baseVDD, enable the I/O resource of the board to be used, and disable all other boards so the driver may operate without identifying the multiple boards that are installed.</P>
</TD>
<TD width=46%>Access the PCI configuration from the display driver and disable the resource when the driver is not accessing the adapter.
<P><B>Accessing the PCI Configuration</B> When multiple identical boards are installed, it is difficult for the PCI BIOS to identify the boards. Therefore, the PCI configuration must be accessed.</P>

<P>The system function: </P>

<P><B>CONFIGMG_Call_Enumerator_Function</B> Must be called from the miniVDD to access the PCI configuration. However, the call cannot be made directly from the display driver;  the interface between the display driver and miniVDD must be used.</P>

<P>Refer to the Index section and the Help in DDK regarding information about <B>CONFIGMG_Call_Enumerator_Function</B>.</P>

<P><B>User Interface</B></P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%><B>Settings for Determining if the Secondary is Used</B>
<P>By default, the primary display adapter is used as a desktop and the secondary display adapter is not used as a desktop (setting equivalent to current single monitor).</P>

<P>The multimonitor environment is enabled by setting the secondary display adapter to be used as a desktop. (The secondary adapter is not initialized when the machine is booted. Thus the BIOS is initialized at startup and the copyright information is displayed. If the secondary display adapter is not being used as a desktop, this display remains.)</P>

<P>No interface can change the primary display adapter because it is determined by the BIOS (VGA resource allocation).</P>
</TD>
<TD width=52%>The primary display adapter is generally the last adapter to be detected. However, the internal accelerators may be set as the primary display adapter by the user. To do this, open the <B>Device Manager</B> dialog box, click the <B>General </B>tab, click <B>Device Usage,</B> and then select the <B>Use as Primary Display Adapter</B> check box.  
<P>(Reference 1: Property dialog) </P>

<P>* The appearance of the dialog is subject to change because the provided sample dialog is only in the development stage. </P>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%><B>Settings for each monitor</B>
<P>In Control Panel<B>, </B>select a display adapter to view its <B>Display Properties</B> dialog box. Click the <B>Settings</B> tab to view the options for  detail settings, such as screen resolution and the number of colors. There are no limitations to the resolution and refresh rate settings. Each monitor can be used with any specified settings.</P>
</TD>
<TD width=52%>Same specification as AT machines.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%><B>Setting the relative position of each monitor</B>
<P>By dragging each monitor in the upper portion of the following properties dialog, the relative position of each monitor can be changed. The transition of the mouse between monitors and displaying a spanned windows display is determined according to the specified position relationship. (The monitors cannot be separated or overlap each other. The display is auto-saved in an adjacent arrangement with the mouse enabled to move between monitors where the adjacent parts meet.) </P>
</TD>
<TD width=52%>Same specification as AT machines.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%><B>Task bar and icons placements</B>
<P>In the US version Developer Release, the task bar and the icon can only be displayed in the primary display adapter. The next BETA version release is expected to support arbitrary placements of the task bar and the icons on any monitor.</P>
</TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%><B>Full-screen command prompt</B>
<P>The full-screen command prompt (MS-DOS mode) can be used only in the primary display adapter (during window display, a full-screen command prompt can be used in any monitor). </P>
