<P>A device driver controls and manages the device hardware. Device drivers are responsible for identifying the specific resource requirements of the given device and for setting the device to operate with the configuration assigned by the Configuration Manager. The Configuration Manager provides services and messages that a device driver can use to carry out its tasks. In particular, a device driver can register a configuration handler function by using the <B>CONFIGMG_Register_Device_Driver</B> service. Once the handler is registered, the Configuration Manager sends it configuration messages whenever it needs the device driver to carry out a configuration task. </P>

<P>These are the device driver services. </P>
