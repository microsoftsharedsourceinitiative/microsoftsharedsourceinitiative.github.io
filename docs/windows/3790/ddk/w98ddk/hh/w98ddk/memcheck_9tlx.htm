<P>Memcheck is an application used to keep track of nearly all memory allocations and deallocations that occur in ring zero while Microsoft® Windows® is booted, during run time. Memcheck is also useful for measuring the memory footprints used by all of the various ring zero components residing in Windows. </P>

<P>Though Memcheck does not automatically and singularly detect memory leaks, it provides the user with the capacity to identify and troubleshoot memory leaks to a surprisingly precise level. The user is provided two main interfaces: the Memcheck application window and the Memcheck debugger interface. </P>

<P>The first, and most obvious, is the Memcheck application window, which displays a list of drivers, how much swappable and fixed memory they each have allocated, and in how many handles. The display refreshes on a default interval of three seconds. This interval can be modified by the user when the program is launched using a command-line parameter (/t <I>xxx</I>, where <I>xxx</I> is an integer representing how many seconds to wait between snapshots). Such an interface is provided to the user for the purpose of identifying suspicious or questionable memory management in ring zero during run time. </P>

<P>Should it become evident that some ring zero component is leaking resources, a more precise and in-depth interface is provided. This second interface is accessed through the <A HREF="dbgmain_2xid.htm">Windows System Debugger</A> (<I>wdeb98.exe</I> /<I> rterm98.exe</I> for Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE, and <I>debugger.exe</I> / <I>rterm.exe</I> for Windows Me). </P>
