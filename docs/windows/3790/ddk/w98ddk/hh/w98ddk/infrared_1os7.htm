<H1><A NAME="_pss_807"></A>Microsoft Releases IR Products</H1>

<P>A Microsoft development team that focuses on mobile computing issues has just released its first products: the Infrared (IR) Communications for Windows 95 device driver, and the IR Communications for Windows 95 device driver kit (DDK), which was developed with Hewlett-Packard. The driver is also part of the DDK. </P>

<P>Software developers can get the IR Communications device driver from the Windows Driver Library (WDL) and can install the driver on computers with IR ports to add IR capability to Windows® 95. </P>

<P>Communicating applications that use serial and parallel cable links can then be tested over the new IR link, which can operate at speeds up to 115.2 kilobits per second (Kbps). </P>

<P>Hardware vendors (IHVs) and computer platform makers (OEMs) can get the Windows 95 IR Communications DDK from the MSDN Development Platform CD or by contacting their Microsoft OEM sales representative. IHVs and OEMs can use the sample IR driver source code as a starting point to build IR drivers that operate with their IR-capable devices. Examples of such IR-capable devices are IR ports built into computer platforms and IR adapters that plug into serial and/or parallel ports built into computer platforms, LAN-access points, remote keyboards, printers, cellular and land-line phones, digital cameras, pagers, home entertainment center equipment, and kitchen appliances. </P>

<P>Based on feedback from computer manufacturers, Microsoft predicts that the majority of new portable PC systems will ship with built-in IR ports which are compatible with Windows 95. For systems without IR ports built-in, Microsoft is working with IHVs that make IR adapters that plug into Windows 95 computer serial ports and provide IR capability. </P>

<P>Companies that have not thought of themselves as makers of computer peripherals, such as manufacturers of kitchen appliances, home entertainment centers, and cameras will likely build IR into their devices and become potential Windows 95 IHVs. </P>

<P>The Infrared Data Association (IrDA) has already developed Infrared communications standards that are accepted by the computer, communications, home entertainment, and semiconductor industries. For a description of the standards, see <I>The IrDA and Its Standards</I>.) As long as the makers of these different devices strive to comply with the IrDA standards, all these different types of IR devices will be able to communicate with each other and with computers running the IR Communications for Windows 95 IR device driver. In the rest of this article, the term <I>IrDA-compliant</I> is used to refer to all these types of IR devices. </P>
