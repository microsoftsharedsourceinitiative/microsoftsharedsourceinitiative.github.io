<P>A local FSD uses a block device driver to do I/O to a disk device. The FSD maintains a specific format on the disk device and supports the IFS interface by manipulating this disk format. When the first request is made for accessing a logical disk drive, a linkage between the FSD and the disk device driver is established through a mount operation initiated by the IFS. The mount operation allows the FSD to verify that it recognizes the disk format. The FSD can then create its own structures required to manage the specific disk volume in the drive. Local FSDs register with the IFS manager using the IFSMgr_RegisterMount service and get called on the FS_MountVolume entry point to be mounted on a volume. Once mounted, all requests are routed through the interface established as a result of the mount operation. </P>
