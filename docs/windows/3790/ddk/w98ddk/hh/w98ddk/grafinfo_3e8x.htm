<P>The fBlockOut dialog box contains controls which specify how the Universal Printer Driver formats each block of raster-graphic data to be sent to the printer. A block is defined as having a height of n scan lines where n is equal to the sNPins control. (For more information about the sNPins control, see <A HREF="grafinfo_19bn.htm">Number of Pins</A>.) The fBlockOut dialog box controls the following bits:

<UL>
	<LI>Whether the Universal Printer Driver should strip leading, embedded, and trailing blanks from the bitmap data prior to sending the data to the printer.</LI>

	<LI>Whether the Universal Printer Driver needs to reset the currently selected device font after printing bitmap data.</LI>

	<LI>Whether the printer requires undirectional printing with the specified resolution.</LI>

	<LI>Whether the printer cannot fire adjacent pins in the print head.</LI>

	<LI>Whether the Universal Printer Driver needs to reset the raster data-compression mode after printing bitmap data.</LI>

	<LI>Whether the minidriver provides a callback function which alters bitmap data prior to printing.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The following table briefly describes the controls in the fBlockOut dialog box.</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The term strip raster graphics data means that Universal Printer Driver will substitute available cursor-movement commands in place of nonprinting raster-graphic data. This usually results in a performance gain because cursor-movement commands typically require less data when sent to the printer. Most printers will benefit from using the RES_BO_TRAILING_BLNKS bit. However, due to differences in the resolutions of cursor-movement commands and graphics resolutions, care must be exercised when using the RES_BO_LEADING_BLNKS and RES_BO_ENCLOSED_BLNKS bits to ensure that horizontal misalignment of graphic output does not occur.</P>

<H4>Diconix 150 Plus</H4>

<P>For the Diconix 150 Plus printer, the RES_BO_TRAILING_BLNKS box is checked in order to delete trailing blanks from a bitmap. However, the RES_BO_LEADING_BLNKS and RES_BO_ENCLOSED_BLNKS boxes are not checked because the available methods of moving the cursor do provide a high enough degree of accuracy.</P>

<H4>HP LaserJet IIP</H4>

<P>For the HP LaserJet IIP printer, the RES_BO_ENCLOSED_BLNKS box is checked in order to delete blanks enclosed in the bitmap. The RES_BO_TRAILING_BLNKS box is also checked in order to delete trailing blanks from a bitmap. However, the RES_BO_LEADING_BLNKS box is not checked. (The performance of HP PCL minidrivers is significantly reduced when this box is checked and the Universal Printer Driver removes leading blanks from a bitmap.)</P>
