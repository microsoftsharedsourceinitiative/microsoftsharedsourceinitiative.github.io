<P>In order to present a uniform system access model to the user when multiple networks are present, and to control access to certain generic system resources such as the password caching subsystem, a system logon facility is implemented in Windows 95. This has a dialog similar to the log on in Windows for Workgroups. Individual NPs have entrypoints which are called for log on and log off, which can perform network-specific operations, optionally using the same information (user name and password) provided for the system log on or providing additional UI. Since logging off may imply unloading the user's profile (user-specific registry keys), applications are shut down at log off exactly as if the user had chosen to exit Windows. System components and service applications can detect log on and log off by listening for the WM_USERCHANGED message to be broadcast. </P>

<P>Because a log on can fail, the user may be logged on to some networks but not others. If the user subsequently tries to use a resource on a network where log on was unsuccessful, the log on is handled as part of the authentication process for that resource. </P>

<P>The user may also have a User Profile (per-user portion of the registry) stored on a network server. Since log on to that network is probably required before the profile can be accessed, one NP can be designated the Primary Logon Provider. That NP is responsible for displaying the logon UI (a service is provided to display a standard dialog) and returning the user name and password to MPR. The user is logged on to that network, the profile is loaded, and then log on occurs for other networks. </P>

<P>Log on can also occur when a new network card or other transmission medium is made available to the system (for example, hot-docking a portable, inserting a PCMCIA card, or establishing a dial-up connection). All network providers are called to perform additional log on in these scenarios. </P>
