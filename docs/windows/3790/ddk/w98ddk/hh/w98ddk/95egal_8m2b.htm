<P>This documentation contains material relevant primarily to the Windows 95 DDK. It is included here to address hardware technologies that are not supported by WDM. While some information may be outdated or made obsolete by newer material contained in the Windows 98 DDK, other information may still be pertinent. Programmers are encouraged to refer to this material as required and to supplement the Windows 98 DDK (WDM) documentation with the information contained here.</P>

<P>This section makes occasional references to the file paths and file names that are unique to the Windows 95 DDK CD-ROM. If those exact files or folders are needed, you will have to refer to the original Windows 95 DDK CD-ROM, since the content of the Windows 98 DDK is not the same.</P>

<P>The Windows 98 DDK contains updates to the original source code samples originally contained in the Windows 95 DDK. The updated Windows 98 header files should be of interest to developers of drivers targeted specifically to Windows 98. Build all sample drivers, including legacy Windows 95 samples, using the instructions provided in the Windows 98 DDK documentation.</P>
