<DD>Specifies a pointer to a <B>MIXERCONTROLDETAILS</B> structure that references the <B>MIXERCONTROLDETAILS</B> structures to set the controls details to. </DD>

<DT><I>dwParam2</I> </DT>

<DD>Specifies flags for setting the line control details. This argument is identical to the <I>fdwDetails</I> argument passed to the <B>mixerSetControlDetails</B> function.

<P>An audio mixer driver must support this message. The Mixer Manager will validate the following parameters for the MXDM_SETCONTROLDETAILS message before calling the driver. Your driver does not need to check for the following conditions: 

<OL>
	<LI><I>dwParam1</I> will contain a valid pointer to a <B>MIXERCONTROLDETAILS</B> structure. This structure will be at least large enough to hold the base <B>MIXERCONTROLDETAILS</B> structure members. This buffer has also been validated to insure it is big enough to hold at least <B>cbStruct</B> bytes of information. </LI>

	<LI>All members of the <B>MIXERCONTROLDETAILS</B> structure have been validated to contain proper structure sizes and a valid pointer to one or more mixer control details structures. </LI>

	<LI><I>dwParam2</I> will be a valid combination of flags. </LI>

	<LI>If the request is for MIXER_SETCONTROLDETAILSF_CUSTOM, then the <B>hwndOwner</B> of the <B>MIXERCONTROLDETAILS</B> structure is a valid window handle (which can be NULL) to use as the owner for the custom mixer control's dialog box. </LI>
</OL>

<P>However, a mixer driver should verify the following: 

<UL>
	<LI>The control identifier. </LI>

	<LI>The size of the details buffer for a custom mixer control. </LI>

	<LI>All control values to insure they are in the correct ranges for the specified control. </LI>

	<LI><B>MIXERCONTROLDETAILS</B>.<B>cChannels</B>. This member must be zero for custom mixer controls. This member must be nonzero for standard mixer controls. </LI>

	<LI>If the calling application specifies <B>cChannels</B> equal to one for a multi-channel control, then the driver must set all channel values to the specified single value. </LI>

	<LI><B>MIXERCONTROLDETAILS</B>.<B>cMultipleItems</B>. It is invalid to specify any number for <B>cMultipleItems</B> other than the value given in the <B>cMultipleItems</B> member of the <B>MIXERCONTROL</B> structure. </LI>
</UL>

<P>If the user cancels a custom mixer control dialog, then the mixer driver should return the current state of the mixer control and succeed the call with MMSYSERR_NOERROR. </P>

<P>An application can set details for standard and custom controls. A driver must use the bitwise AND operator with <I>dwParam2</I> and the MIXER_SETCONTROLDETAILSF_QUERYMASK constant to identify the type of information being set. 

<UL>
	<LI>If the result matches the MIXER_SETCONTROLDETAILSF_VALUE constant, the details for a standard control are set to the specified state. </LI>

	<LI>If the result matches the MIXER_SETCONTROLDETAILSF_CUSTOM constant, the details for a customer control are set to the specified state. </LI>
</UL>

<P>All mixer drivers must support these queries. If a query other than those previously mentioned is sent, the mixer driver must return MMSYSERR_NOTSUPPORTED. </P>
