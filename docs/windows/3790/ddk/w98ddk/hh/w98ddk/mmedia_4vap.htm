<P>If the same hardware is required or used for a combination of video capture and video compression, you might combine both of these functions into a common DLL and use a single <B>DriverProc</B> entry point to service them. The common entry point will simplify the coordination of the different functions. </P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because video capture drivers can rely on video compression and decompression drivers for efficient operation, a single driver can handle both video capture, and video compression and decompression services. Video capture drivers use the VIDEO_OPEN_PARMS data structure when they are opened. This structure has the same member definitions as the ICOPEN structure used by video compression and decompression drivers. By examining the fccType member, a combined driver can determine whether it is being opened as a video capture driver or a video compression and decompression driver. (Video capture devices contain the four-character code 'vcap' in this member.) For more information on video compression and decompression drivers, see <I>Video Compression and Decompression Drivers</I>. </P>
