<P>The structures in the printer data table contain device-command strings. There are three formats that you can use to type command strings in UniTool:</P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=48%>Format</TH>
<TH align=left width=52%>Description</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>ASCII</TD>
<TD width=52%>Literal ASCII characters can be typed as part of a command string.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>Hexadecimal</TD>
<TD width=52%>Hexadecimal values are preceded by the following two characters: \x. For example, the hexadecimal value 0xFF would be typed as \xFF in UniTool.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>Formatted parameter</TD>
<TD width=52%>A formatted parameter is a parameter that is supplied by the Universal Printer Driver, and sent to the printer in a format based on the specified conversion characters. These conversion characters are always preceded by the percent (%) character.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>The following table contains the conversion characters which are supported by the Universal Printer Driver, as well as a brief description of each.</P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=48%>Character</TH>
<TH align=left width=52%>Description</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>d</TD>
<TD width=52%>The Universal Printer Driver will convert the parameter to a decimal value. (For example, the value 12 will be sent as '1' (31h) followed by '2' (32h).)</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>D</TD>
<TD width=52%>The Universal Printer Driver will convert the parameter to a signed decimal value. This is the same as the %d character except it is preceded by a sign.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>c</TD>
<TD width=52%>The Universal Printer Driver will convert the parameter to a byte value. (For example, the value 12 will be sent as FF (0Ch))</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>l</TD>
<TD width=52%>The Universal Printer Driver will convert the parameter to a 16-bit value with the Least Significant Byte (LSB) first. (For example, the value 12 will be sent as FF (0Ch) followed by NULL (00h))</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>m</TD>
<TD width=52%>The Universal Printer Driver will convert the parameter to a 16-bit value with the Most Significant Byte (MSB) first. This is the same as %l except the order of the bytes is reversed.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>q</TD>
<TD width=52%>The Universal Printer Driver will convert the parameter to a unique hexadecimal value formatted for Toshiba and Qume devices.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>There are two types of printer commands which you will type in UniTool. The first type enables or disables certain features of the printer. For example, the command string ESCx3 enables letter-quality output of the Kodak Diconix 150 Plus printer. This command (ESCx3) is typed as \x1Bx\x03 in the Text Qualities dialog box. The string ESC was replaced by its ASCII representation (\x1B), the argument x was not altered, and the decimal value 3 was replaced by its hexadecimal equivalent (\x03). The second type of command contains parameters that are supplied by the Universal Printer Driver at runtime (when the command is used). For example, the Immediate Line Feed command for the Diconix printer is used to advance the cursor in the positive y-direction with respect to the current cursor position. The command string for the Immediate Line Feed command has the following syntax:</P>

<PRE>ESC J n</PRE>

<P>In this example, n is the number of 1/288th inch increments that the cursor will advance. The ESC string was again replaced by its ASCII representation (\x1B), the argument J was not altered, and the variable n was replaced by the conversion character indicating that it is a byte value (%c).</P>
