<P class=note><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You must always remove any previously installed version of the IR communications driver every time you install the driver. For example, if you have an earlier (Beta) version of the IR communications driver already installed you must remove it before you install Version 1.0 </P>

<OL>
	<LI>If you are using an IR adapter (rather than a built-in IR device), make sure the adapter is physically attached to a COM port and note which COM port it is (COM1, COM2, and so on). If you are using a computer with a built-in IR device, note which COM port that device is assigned to. </LI>

	<LI>Start the setup program SETUP.EXE, which is one of the IR communications components, to invoke the Windows 95 Add Infrared Device Wizard. Respond to the wizard's prompts for physical COM port information, IR device manufacturer and model information, and so on. </LI>

	<LI>If the wizard announces New Hardware Found events for the IR serial and parallel ports, you can enable the IR device immediately after the wizard is finished. Enable the IR device by double-clicking on the Infrared device icon in Control Panel. If the wizard does not announce New Hardware Found events before it is finished, you must restart the computer before you use Control Panel icon to activate the IR device. </LI>
</OL>
