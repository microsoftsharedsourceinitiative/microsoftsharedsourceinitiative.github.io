<P>Devices that are not in use should be put into low power states to conserve power. Under OnNow, the responsibility for managing power to devices is divided into three parts:

<UL>
	<LI><B>Policy Owners</B> decide when a device should switch power states.</LI>

	<LI><B>Device Drivers</B> save and restore any hardware context lost by switching to a low power state.</LI>

	<LI><B>Bus Drivers</B> use standard interfaces to signal hardware to switch to a low power state and possibly remove power from the device. This includes the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) driver.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The following topics describe the roles of policy owners, device drivers, and bus drivers in device power management.</P>
