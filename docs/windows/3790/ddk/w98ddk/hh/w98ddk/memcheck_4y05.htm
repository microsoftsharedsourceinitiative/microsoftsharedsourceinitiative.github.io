<P>Memcheck automatically generates one or two log files. The first and most important log file is located at <I>c:\mcxsnap.log</I>. This log file contains nothing but snapshots and is appended to every time the display refreshes on the application window (coinciding with the time that the driver tabulates and assembles a ring zero memory report). </P>

<P>This file is helpful for stress testing. If the user notices that there is no more memory available in the system, but cannot immediately isolate an offending component, this file can be parsed out and a pattern can be identified by the user. A separate tool is provided with Memcheck to parse the log file and chart out memory activity on a per-driver basis. Basically, any driver showing an unacceptable increase in memory usage should be investigated further for memory leaks. </P>

<P>The second file contains records of ring zero memory allocation and deallocation errors. It is located at <I>c:\mcxerr.log</I>. For more information on these errors see <A HREF="memcheck_9m05.htm">Memcheck Errors</A>. The parser, Memparse, currently shipping with Memcheck, will intake both of these files and chronologically associate each error with its corresponding driver and snapshot number. </P>

<P>Memparse parses a given <I>mcxsnap.log</I> file into a set of text files containing graphs of each drivers' memory behavior trends. By default, Memparse operates on <I>c:\mcxsnap.log</I> and outputs its chart files in <I>c:\memparse\.txt</I>. These locations can be changed with the /f: and /d: command-line parameters. The output files are designed to be viewable on a 25x80 console.</P>
