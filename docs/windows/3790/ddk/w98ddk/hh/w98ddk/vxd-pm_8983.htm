<P>OnNow determines when to switch power states based on the activity of devices. The policy owner for a given device class may be any where in the operating system or device driver stack. Most of the time, this is the device driver because it knows if the device has any open handles. If the device does have any open handles, it should be on. To be most effective, the owner must be the code that has the most knowledge regarding when a device is needed. </P>

<P>The power policies for audio, communications, display, input, network, PC Card, and storage device classes are in the Device Power Management specifications available on http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/onnow.htm<U> </U></P>
