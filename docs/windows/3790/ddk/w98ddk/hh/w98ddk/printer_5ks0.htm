<P>The color profile must be included in the list of dependent files (that is, included in the CopyFiles= list entry in the INF file). For general information about Windows 95 INF files, see <I>About INF Files and the INF File Editor</I>. For an example CopyFiles= list entry that includes a color profile, see the entry for the Kodak® ColorEase printer in the MSPRINT.INF file. </P>

<P>Multiple color profiles, which are used for different media types or driver configurations, can be included in the list of dependent files. </P>
