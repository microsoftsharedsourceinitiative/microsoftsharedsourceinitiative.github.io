<P>The following sections describe how to write a virtual device driver. The VDD is a 32-bit DLL that runs in user mode on NT-based operating systems. Its purpose is to translate requests from MS-DOS programs into calls to a 32-bit kernel-mode device driver. The VDD serves as a bridge between the 16-bit MS-DOS application and the 32-bit kernel-mode driver. The VDD can be called directly from a modified MS-DOS application, as explained in <A HREF="vdd_9cz7.htm">Application-Based Intercepts</A> or it can rely on the VDM to intercept device access requests from the application and route them to callback functions the VDD has installed.</P>
