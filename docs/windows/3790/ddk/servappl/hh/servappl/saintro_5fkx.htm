<P>The local display miniport driver must define a device extension structure that contains information about the hardware resources and the current state of the local display device. This structure includes the following members: 

<UL>
	<LI>A pointer to a DEVICE_OBJECT object. The local display miniport driver assigns this object pointer to the local display device's object pointer during initialization. The SA port driver creates the local display device's object and passes a pointer to this object in a call to the miniport driver's <A HREF="samini_55pd.htm"><I>SaHwInitialize</I></A> function. </LI>

	<LI>An internal buffer to hold the display information that is transferred from the requesting application to the local display device. </LI>

	<LI>Variable to hold the size of the internal buffer.</LI>

	<LI>An object, such as a spin lock or a mutex, to synchronize access to members of this device extension structure.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The device extension can also contain additional members to support queries or data transfer operations that are beyond the basic functionality of a local display miniport driver.</P>

<P>The local display miniport driver's callback functions subsequently use this device extension structure to execute I/O operations with the local display device. </P>
