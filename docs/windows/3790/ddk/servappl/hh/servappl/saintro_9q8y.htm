<P>The keypad miniport driver must define a device extension structure that contains information about the hardware resources and the current state of the keypad device. This structure includes the following members: 

<UL>
	<LI>An internal buffer. To indicate that a read request is in process, the keypad miniport driver can assign this internal buffer to the external buffer that receives the key-press data. For more information, see <A HREF="saintro_3mox.htm">Transferring Key-Press Information</A>. </LI>

	<LI>A variable to hold the identity of the key that was last pressed. </LI>

	<LI>An object to synchronize access to members of this device extension structure, for example, a spin lock or a mutex. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The device extension can also contain additional members to support queries or data transfer operations that are beyond the basic functionality of a keypad miniport driver.</P>

<P>The keypad miniport driver's callback functions subsequently use this device extension structure to execute I/O operations with the keypad device. </P>
