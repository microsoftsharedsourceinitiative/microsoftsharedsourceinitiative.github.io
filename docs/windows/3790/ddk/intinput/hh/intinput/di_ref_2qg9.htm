<H4>Parameters</H4>

<DL>
<DT><I>dwDeviceID</I> </DT>

<DD>Indicates the external joystick number being addressed. </DD>

<DT><I>dwState</I> </DT>

<DD>Indicates the command being sent. That command can be one of the following: 

<DL>
<DT>DISFFC_RESET </DT>

<DD>Indicates that playback of any active effects should be stopped and that all effects should be removed from the device. Once the device has been reset, all effects are no longer valid and must be re-created. </DD>

<DT>DISFFC_STOPALL </DT>

<DD>Indicates that playback of all effects should be stopped. Sending the DISFFC_STOPALL command is equivalent to invoking the <B>IDirectInputEffect::Stop</B> method on all effects that are playing. If the device is in a paused state, the device driver is permitted to lose the paused state. </DD>

<DT>DISFFC_PAUSE </DT>

<DD>Indicates that playback of all effects should be paused. When effects are paused, time "stops" until the DISFFC_CONTINUE command is sent. For example, suppose an effect of five seconds' duration is started. After one second, all effects are paused. After two more seconds, all effects are continued. The effect should then play for four additional seconds. While a force-feedback device is paused, starting a new effect or modifying existing ones can cause the paused state to be lost. </DD>

<DT>DISFFC_CONTINUE </DT>

<DD>Indicates that playback should be resumed at the point at which it was interrupted for those effects that were paused by a previous DISCFFC_PAUSE command. </DD>

<DT>DISFFC_SETACTUATORSON </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the device's force-feedback actuators should be enabled. </DD>

<DT>DISFFC_SETACTUATORSOFF </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the device's force-feedback actuators should be disabled. If successful, force-feedback effects are "muted". Note that time continues to elapse while actuators are off. For example, suppose an effect of five seconds' duration is started. After one second, actuators are turned off. After two more seconds, actuators are turned back on. The effect should then play for two additional seconds. 
</DD>
</DL>
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Return Value</H4>

<P>Returns S_OK if successful; otherwise returns an error value. </P>
