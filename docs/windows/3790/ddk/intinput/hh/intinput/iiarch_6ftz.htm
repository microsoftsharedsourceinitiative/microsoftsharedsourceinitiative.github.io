<P>The <I>HIDClass device setup class</I> includes all devices that are accessed through the <A HREF="iiarch_0i07.htm">HID class driver</A>. HIDClass devices include the following:

<UL>
	<LI>USB HID devices, which are devices that comply with the <A HREF="hidclass_823r.htm">USB HID Standard</A> and accessed through the USB <A HREF="iiarch_6td3.htm">HID minidriver</A>.</LI>

	<LI>Non-USB input devices that use a HID minidriver to provide access to the device.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Devices that are fully supported by the system include the following:

<UL>
	<LI>USB keyboard and mouse devices</LI>

	<LI>USB joystick devices (Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;Me)</LI>

	<LI>Game port (I/O port 201) devices (Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions)</LI>
</UL>

<P>If a vendor supplies a HID minidriver for a custom device, the device can be operated as HIDClass device. For example, a camera that connects to a USB port or a serial port can be supported this way. If a vendor supplies a serial port HID minidriver for the camera, a single user-mode application can control the camera through Microsoft DirectInput®. The port that the camera is connected to is transparent to the application.</P>

<P>HIDClass includes parent input devices and the child devices (HID collections) supported by the parent input devices. For example, a parent USB device might support the functionality of a standard keyboard and a mouse. The keyboard and the mouse are enumerated as different HID collections.</P>
