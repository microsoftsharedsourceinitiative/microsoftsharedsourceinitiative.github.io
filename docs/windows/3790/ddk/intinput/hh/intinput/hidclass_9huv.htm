<P>This section describes the general requirements on vendor-supplied HID minidrivers for pen devices and button devices that are installed on a Table PC. A pen device is integrated with the Table PC's LCD display and is used to capture the motion of a pen stylus. A button device supplements the pen device and is used to capture button input. For more information about the Tablet&nbsp;PC, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=10013&clcid=0x409" target="_blank">Windows XP Tablet PC Edition</A> Web site.</P>

<P>For detailed information about system-supplied software that supports the Tablet&nbsp;PC, see the Tablet&nbsp;PC documentation in the Platform SDK.</P>

<P>Pen and button devices belong to the <A HREF="iiarch_6ftz.htm">HIDClass device setup class</A>. These devices are operated by the system-supplied <A HREF="iiarch_0i07.htm">HID class driver</A>, which is linked to a <A HREF="iiarch_6td3.htm">HID minidriver</A>. In the absence of a system-supplied HID minidriver that supports the hardware interface for a device, a vendor-supplied HID minidriver is required. The structure of the driver stack (and the corresponding device stack) for these devices complies with that described in <A HREF="hidclass_7wh3.htm">Device Stacks for Generic HIDClass Devices</A>. The devices are operated from user mode by using the system-supplied Tablet&nbsp;PC API, which is described in the Platform SDK documentation.</P>
