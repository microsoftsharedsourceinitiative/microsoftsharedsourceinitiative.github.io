<P>DirectInput® supports new notification messages that are broadcast to notify when DirectInput applications have begun to use DirectInput services. These notifications can be used to detect recently started applications that use DirectInput and how those applications are making use of DirectInput’s features. Your application can register for notifications by calling the Win32® function, RegisterWindowMessage, and passing DIRECTINPUT_NOTIFICATION_MSGSTRING (defined in <I>dinputd.h</I>).</P>

<P>As with any other call to RegisterNotificationMessageString, the UINT value returned by the function is the message value that registered applications should hook in their window process. Once received, the <I>wParam</I> parameter for the message describes the type of notification being sent. The value of wParam is one of the following constants, defined in <I>dinputd.h</I>:
