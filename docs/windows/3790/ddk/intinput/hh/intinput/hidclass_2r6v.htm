<P>A Tablet&nbsp;PC pen device must:

<UL>
	<LI>Provide a top-level collection whose usage page is Digitizer and whose usage is Pen (see <A HREF="hidclass_8nmv.htm">HID usages</A>).</LI>

	<LI>If a Tablet&nbsp;PC does not include a built-in mouse, a Tablet&nbsp;PC pen device must provide a top-level collection whose usage page is Generic Desktop and whose usage is Mouse. The purpose for the Mouse collection is to enable the system mouse cursor. However, the Mouse collection must not generate input reports. Only input from the Pen collection should be used for cursor movement. (If the Tablet&nbsp;PC's operating system boots without an installed mouse device, the system does not display a mouse cursor and does not handle the pen collection as a mouse device.)</LI>

	<LI>Report raw data only. The driver must not compensate for linearity, pen tilt, display rotation, or scaling. These transformations are handled by the Tablet&nbsp;PC API. However, the driver must ensure that the pen coordinate system uses the same origin and orientation as that used by the API. For example, the driver must ensure that the origin is at the upper-left corner of a landscape display, that the <I>x</I> coordinate increases from left to right, and that the <I>y</I> coordinate increases from top to bottom.</LI>

	<LI>If the device is a USB device, a Tablet&nbsp;PC pen device must support the <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">selective suspension of USB devices</A>.</LI>
