<P>General information on interfacing to the configuration manager is documented in the Plug and Play Environment portion of the Windows&nbsp;Me section of the DDK. </P>

<P>Because minidrivers are passed the configuration manager callback only if they are loaded when VJoyD receives the callback, a significant problem exists with current implementations of this callback. VJoyD receives callbacks for those device nodes with which it is associated when the device nodes are enumerated during system boot, when the configuration manager sends a message during normal run time for a special event like device reconfiguration, and when the system is closing down. Therefore, only the devices that were selected on the previous boot are loaded in time to receive these messages. This limits the potential number of things that remain to be done when this callback is invoked because a user can boot the system, configure a joystick, play games, deconfigure the joystick, and shut down without this callback ever being called. </P>

<P>For devices that do not need any hardware resources, this is not an issue. Devices that use such resources have several options: they can work only when configured at boot time, they can dynamically allocate the resources from the configuration manager, or they can find out their allocations by searching the registry for their own device node and then that to request the information. </P>

<P>Given the preceding information, driver initialization is best done either when the driver is first loaded and the SYS_DYNAMIC_DEVICE_INIT message is received, or on the first time through the polling routine. Similarly, resources should be freed when a SYS_DYNAMIC_DEVICE_EXIT message is received. </P>

<P>Another issue is that all configuration manager callbacks for currently serviced joystick devices are sent to all loaded minidrivers. This is not bad, however, as the <I>dnToDevNode</I> parameter can be used to look up the device identifier, and this can be checked against the devices this driver can handle. </P>
