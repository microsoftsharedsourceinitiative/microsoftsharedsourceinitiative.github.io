<PRE>int __stdcall JoyIdRoutine( int joyid, BOOL used );
</PRE>

<P>VJoyD calls <B>JoyIDRoutine</B> in response to a user configuring or deconfiguring a joystick as one of the 16 joysticks. If the minidriver can support the ID requested in <I>joyid</I>, <B>JoyIdRoutine</B> returns a nonzero value. If the minidriver cannot support the ID, the routine returns zero. </P>

<P>Whenever any change is made and <B>joyConfigChanged</B> is called to update the driver, VJoyD cycles through all 16 devices, starting with <B>JOYSTICKID1</B> It resets them all to unused and then loops through them again, setting all those that are needed to used. During control panel type operations, this can entail a large number of calls, which makes using this callback for initialization problematic. This is particularly true if the call is made before the system boot is complete, when other services are not available. </P>

<P>Minidrivers that service callbacks for more than one device should attempt to keep joystick identifiers tied to a single physical device, where possible, to avoid user confusion. This can be done relatively easily during a single session, but is probably not necessary over reboots. </P>
