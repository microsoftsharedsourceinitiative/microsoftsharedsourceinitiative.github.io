<P>A Tablet&nbsp;PC button device supplements pen input on a Tablet&nbsp;PC. A button device supports one or more buttons. A button device that is installed on a Tablet&nbsp;PC must:

<UL>
	<LI>Provide one dedicated button for a Secure Attention Sequence (SAS) (as described in the Platform SDK documentation). </LI>

	<LI>Generate an event when a button is pressed and another event when that button is released.</LI>

	<LI>Report distinct button events for each button, regardless of the number of buttons that are simultaneously pressed or released.</LI>

	<LI>Provide a top-level collection whose usage page is Generic Desktop and whose usage is Keyboard (see <A HREF="hidclass_8nmv.htm">HID usages</A>). The Keyboard collection is only used to report SAS button events. When the SAS button is pressed, the following usages must be reported: Left Control, Left Alt, and Delete. </LI>

	<LI>Provide a top-level collection whose usage page is Generic Desktop and whose usage is Tablet&nbsp;PC System Controls. Button events are reported using a button array whose usage page is Button and the usage values range from 1 to the number of buttons. </LI>
</UL>
