<P>The registry is used by the joystick interface to store configuration, calibration, and user preference information. It is also used to store customized text for the calibration program. The Windows&nbsp;95/98/Me joystick calibration program can be customized through the registry to provide instructions to the user during calibration that are specific to the joystick. </P>

<P>The values fall into five groups: </P>

<P class=indent1>Original data supplied by the OEM and installed from an INF file (described above). </P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="di_4wa1.htm">User Values</A> that specify how data is interpreted. </P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="di_5yi1.htm">Current Settings</A> reflecting which devices are currently configured. </P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="di_2zjd.htm">Saved Settings</A> that allow different configurations to be recalled. </P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="di_2quh.htm">Driver Settings</A> that are set up by the configuration manager as a device is set up. </P>

<P>The user values, current settings, and saved settings are all stored in the registry under the path belonging to the "current" joystick driver. Each of the joystick devices for which a driver is installed has a key under the path <B>REGSTR_PATH_JOYCONFIG</B> that has the form <I>Msjstick.drv</I>&lt;<I>xxxx</I>&gt;, where the <I>xxxx</I> is a four-digit number used to keep the key name unique. The number relates to the number of multimedia (sound, video and game controller) drivers that have been installed. At boot time, <I>Msjstick.drv</I> is initialized to the configuration for each of the game controller drivers. Since it can only deal with one configuration at a time, each one replaces the last and the "current" driver is the last one to be initialized. This means that the user is likely to lose all the current settings when a new driver is installed, and a minidriver cannot be structured on the assumption that the path to these registry values will always be the same. </P>
