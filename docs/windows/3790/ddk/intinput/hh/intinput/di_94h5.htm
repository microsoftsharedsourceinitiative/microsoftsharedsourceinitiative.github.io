<P>The "SourceDisksFiles" section of the INF file specifies which files to copy. This includes all necessary drivers, as well as any other files, such as documentation and setup applications. As this may be the first joystick driver to be installed on a user's system, the system joystick drivers <I>Vjoyd.vxd</I> and <I>Msjstrick.drv</I> should be copied, in addition to the specific drivers for this device. The source of these two drivers should be established by reference to <I>Layout.inf</I> (causing the user to be prompted for the Windows&nbsp;95/98/Me installation disc) and not distributed on the OEM disc. The drivers should be copied to the user's system directory, which is destination code 11. </P>
