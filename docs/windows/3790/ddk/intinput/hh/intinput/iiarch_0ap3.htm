<P>As shown in the figure, the USB-related HIDClass components are combined with the non-HIDClass components for keyboard, mouse, and joystick devices, and other user-mode system components.</P>

<P>For information about supporting joystick devices for Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions, see <A HREF="iiarch_26qv.htm">Driver Stacks for HIDClass Game Port Devices</A>.</P>

<P>Vendor drivers are not required for USB keyboard, mouse, and joystick devices. </P>

<P>The system opens all keyboard and mouse collections for its exclusive use. </P>

<P>Joystick devices are shared devices that can be opened from user mode. A user-mode application can indirectly access a joystick through Microsoft® DirectInput®. A user-mode application can also directly access a joystick by using the <A HREF="hidfunc_4uuq.htm">HIDClass support routines</A>. The application calls <B>CreateFile </B>(described in the Platform SDK) to obtain a file handle to a joystick collection and uses the HIDClass support routines to communicate with the collection.</P>
