<H4>Members</H4>

<DL>
<DT><B>dwSize</B> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the size of the structure in bytes. This member must be initialized before the structure is used. </DD>

<DT><B>dwState</B> </DT>

<DD>Indicates various aspects of the device state. Can indicate zero, one, or more of the following: 

<DL>
<DT>DIGFFS_EMPTY </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the force feedback device is devoid of any downloaded effects. </DD>

<DT>DIGFFS_STOPPED </DT>

<DD>Indicates that no effects are currently playing and the device is not paused. </DD>

<DT>DIGFFS_PAUSED </DT>

<DD>Indicates that playback of effects has been paused by a previous DISFFC_PAUSE command. </DD>

<DT>DIGFFS_ACTUATORSON </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the device's force-feedback actuators are enabled. </DD>

<DT>DIGFFS_ACTUATORSOFF </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the device's force-feedback actuators are disabled. </DD>

<DT>DIGFFS_POWERON </DT>

<DD>Indicates that power to the force-feedback system is currently available. If the device cannot report the power state, then neither DIGFFS_POWERON nor DIGFFS_POWEROFF should be returned. </DD>

<DT>DIGFFS_POWEROFF </DT>

<DD>Indicates that power to the force-feedback system is not currently available. If the device cannot report the power state, then neither DIGFFS_POWERON nor DIGFFS_POWEROFF should be returned. </DD>

<DT>DIGFFS_SAFETYSWITCHON </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the safety switch (dead-man switch) is currently on, meaning that the device can operate. If the device cannot report the state of the safety switch, then neither DIGFFS_SAFETYSWITCHON nor DIGFFS_SAFETYSWITCHOFF should be returned. </DD>

<DT>DIGFFS_SAFETYSWITCHOFF </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the safety switch (dead-man switch) is currently off, meaning that the device cannot operate. If the device cannot report the state of the safety switch, then neither DIGFFS_SAFETYSWITCHON nor DIGFFS_SAFETYSWITCHOFF should be returned. </DD>

<DT>DIGFFS_USERFFSWITCHON </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the user force-feedback switch is currently on, meaning that the device can operate. If the device cannot report the state of the user force-feedback switch, then neither DIGFFS_USERFFSWITCHON nor DIGFFS_USERFFSWITCHOFF should be returned. </DD>

<DT>DIGFFS_USERFFSWITCHOFF </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the user force-feedback switch is currently off, meaning that the device cannot operate. If the device cannot report the state of the user force-feedback switch, then neither DIGFFS_USERFFSWITCHON nor DIGFFS_USERFFSWITCHOFF should be returned. </DD>

<DT>DIGFFS_DEVICELOST </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the device suffered an unexpected failure and is in an indeterminate state. It must be reset either by unacquiring and reacquiring the device, or by explicitly sending a DISFFC_RESET command. For example, the device may be lost if the user suspends the computer, causing on-board memory on the device to be lost. </DD>
</DL>
</DD>

<DT><B>dwLoad</B> </DT>

<DD>A value indicating the percentage of device memory in use. A value  of zero indicates that the device memory is completely available. A value of 100 indicates that the device is full. 
</DD>
