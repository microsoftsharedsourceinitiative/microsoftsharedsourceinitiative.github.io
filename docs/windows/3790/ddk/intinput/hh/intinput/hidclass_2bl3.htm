<P>A <I>link collection</I> as a nested subcollection within a <A HREF="hidclass_2w13.htm">top-level collection</A>. A top-level collection can have zero or more link collections.</P>

<P><A HREF="hidfunc_3lwy.htm"><B>HidP_GetLinkCollectionNodes</B></A> returns a top-level collection's <A HREF="#ddk_link_collection_array_kg">link collection array</A>, which contains information about a top-level collection's link collections.</P>



<H4><A NAME="ddk_link_collection_array_kg"></A>Link Collection Array</H4>

<P>A <I>link collection array</I> describes all the link collections contained within a top-level collection. Each link collection is represented by a <A HREF="hidstrct_7j5e.htm">HIDP_LINK_COLLECTION_NODE</A> structure. The array's link nodes are linked in a manner that identifies their sequential and hierarchical order within a top-level collection. The first element of a link collection array represents a top-level collection and the remaining members represent the top-level collection's link collections.</P>

<P>By tracing through the nodes in the link connection array, a user-mode application or kernel-mode driver can determine the organization and usage of all the link collections in a top-level collection. In addition, the application or driver can organize controls by their link collection. This is possible because a top-level collection's <A HREF="hidclass_0g4n.htm">button capability arrays</A> and <A HREF="hidclass_00iv.htm">value capability arrays</A> identify the link collection that contains each <A HREF="hidclass_8nmv.htm">HID usage</A> described by the capability arrays.</P>

<P>The following figure shows an example of a top-level collection containing four link collections.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/linkcol.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>



<P><A NAME="ddk_link_collection_nodes_kg"></A><B>Link Collection Nodes</B></P>

<P>As indicated in the above figure, link collections are linked together in a top-to-bottom and left-to-right order (ABCD). The following table indicates, for each link collection in the example, the links between the top-level collection and its link collections.</P>

<P>In a link collection array, the following definitions hold:

<DL>
<DT><B>Parent</B></DT>

<DD>A link collection's <I>parent</I> is the collection immediately above it in the top-to-bottom hierarchy of collections. Link collections have one parent. The <B>Parent</B> member of a link node specifies the index of its parent in the link collection array.</DD>

<DT><B>Children</B></DT>

<DD>A link collection is a <I>child</I> of its parent. A parent can have zero or more children. The <B>NumberOfChildren</B> member of a link node specifies the number of children that a parent has.</DD>

<DT><B>Sibling</B></DT>

<DD>A parent's children are <I>siblings</I>.</DD>

<DT><B>Next Sibling</B></DT>

<DD>Siblings are ordered left-to-right. A sibling's <I>next sibling</I> is the sibling immediately to its right, if any, in a set of siblings. The <B>NextSibling</B> member of a link collection node specifies the index to its next sibling in the link collection array. If a link collection node does not have a next sibling, <B>NextSibling</B> is set to zero.</DD>

<DT><B>First Child</B></DT>

<DD>The <I>first child</I> is the left-most sibling in a set of siblings. The <B>FirstChild</B> member of a link collection node specifies the index to its first child in the link collection array. If a link collection node has no children, <B>FirstChild</B> is set to zero.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>An application or driver can determine all a parent collection's children by, starting with the parent's first child, sequencing through the siblings of the first child until the <B>NextSibling</B> member of a sibling node is zero.</P>

<P>The following code is an example of using a link collection node index to find the first child of link collection seven:</P>

<PRE>HIDP_LINK_COLLECTION_NODE Collection[10] ;
HIDP_LINK_COLLECTION_NODE Node1 ;
 
Node1 = Collection[Collection[7].FirstChild]] ;</PRE>



<H4><A NAME="ddk_aliased_collections_kg"></A>Aliased Collections</H4>

<P><A HREF="hidclass_9i1z.htm#ddk_delimiter_item_kg">Delimiter items</A> can be used in a report descriptor to delimit a set of <I>aliased collections</I>. Each aliased collection is represented by an aliased link collection node. A complete and unique set of <I>n</I>, <I>n &gt;=2</I>, aliased nodes is linked together in the following way:

<UL>
	<LI>The aliased nodes are in consecutive order in the link collection array.</LI>

	<LI>The first <I>n-1</I> nodes have their <B>IsAlias</B> member set to TRUE. The <I>nth</I> node immediately following such a sequence has its <B>IsAlias</B> member set to FALSE. This node terminates the sequence of aliased nodes. The usage associated with this node is the preferred usage.</LI>
</UL>

<P>An application or driver can determine which collections are aliased by repeatedly incrementing the array index of a link collection array to find such sequences.</P>

<P><A HREF="hidclass_0g4n.htm">Button capabilty arrays</A> and <A HREF="hidclass_00iv.htm">value capability arrays</A> identify, for each usage they describe, the link collection that contains the usage. If a link collection is aliased, the capability arrays specify the preferred usage.</P>
