<P>The Microsoft® Windows® system program installs two icons in the task bar when the current <I>hKL</I> is an IME. One icon is the System ML icon that indicates the current keyboard layout in the system task bar. The other is the System Pen icon that shows the IME status of the focused window. </P>

<P>Usually, an IME places an additional icon in the task bar. The context menu for this icon is completely dependent on the IME. Having IME icons in a task bar is a quick way for a user to access an IME’s special functions. However, there are three icons associated with the IME and these additional icons may be more than a user wants to deal with.</P>
