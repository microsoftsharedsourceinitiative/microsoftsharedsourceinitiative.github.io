<P>Microsoft® Windows&nbsp;XP and later versions include Windows® Driver Protection. Windows Driver Protection prevents the installation of drivers known to cause instabilities when installed under Windows&nbsp;XP. Windows&nbsp;XP includes a list of such drivers, known as the "driver protection list," and the list is checked at the following times:

<UL>
	<LI>During installation of Windows&nbsp;XP </LI>

	<LI>Each time the system is rebooted </LI>

	<LI>Each time a device or application is installed </LI>
</UL>

<P>Whenever a system connects to the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=8712&clcid=0x409" target="_blank">Windows Update driver publishing</A> Web site, the system's driver protection list is updated. If a driver on the list was previously installed, the driver will be disabled and the user will be told how to obtain a new driver.</P>

<P>The decision to add drivers to the driver protection list is based on feedback from end users about problems that can be reproduced by Microsoft.</P>
