<P>This guide organizes driver development into six steps, listed below. Each step corresponds to a section in the DDK.

<UL>
	<LI>Step 1: <A HREF="gs_basics_1v8n.htm">Understand Driver and Operating System Basics</A>
<P>Before starting design, you should understand the fundamentals of how drivers work in Windows operating systems. Knowing the fundamentals will help you make appropriate design decisions and streamline your development process. 
</LI>

	<LI>Step 2: <A HREF="gs_devspc_64pz.htm">Determine Device-Specific Driver Requirements</A>
<P>Each Windows device class has specific hardware and software requirements. Devices and drivers should conform to these requirements to operate correctly with other system components. 

<P>Understanding and following these requirements during hardware and software design can save you time and money.
</LI>

	<LI>Step 3: <A HREF="gs_design_2esn.htm">Make Driver Design Decisions</A>
<P>Before you write any code, you need to make some fundamental decisions about driver design. For example, you should decide which Windows operating systems and hardware platforms your driver will run on, and whether you can modify an existing sample or legacy driver or instead should start from scratch. 
</LI>

	<LI>Step 4: <A HREF="gs_debug_8gvb.htm">Build, Test, and Debug the Driver</A>
<P>Building a driver is not the same as building a user-mode application. This section gives tips on how to use the "free" and "checked" operating system builds and how to configure the build environment for a driver.

<P>Iterative testing and debugging on as many hardware configurations as possible helps to ensure a working driver. 
</LI>

	<LI>Step 5: <A HREF="gs_install_3z3b.htm">Provide a Driver Package</A> 
<P>Exactly how a driver must be installed depends on the type of driver and device. This section helps you determine which device installation components you must provide, and outlines what Windows expects during device installation.
</LI>

	<LI>Step 6: <A HREF="gs_sign_44x3.htm">Distribute the Driver</A>
<P>The final step in driver development is to distribute the driver. If your driver meets the quality standards defined for the Microsoft Windows Logo program, you can distribute it through Microsoft's Windows Update program.
