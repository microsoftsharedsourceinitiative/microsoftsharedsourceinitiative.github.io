<P>There are special cases where the driver writer might want to reorder textures in AGP memory to allow more efficient texture management. The DDCAPS2_SYSTONONLOCAL_AS_SYSTOLOCAL flag signals that the driver can support blts from backing surfaces (system memory copy of a surface) to nonlocal video memory using all the same caps that were specified for backing surface memory to local video memory blts.</P>

<P>The DDCAPS2_SYSTONONLOCAL_AS_SYSTOLOCAL flag is valid only if the DDCAPS2_NONLOCALVIDMEMCAPS flag is set. If DDCAPS2_SYSTONONLOCAL_AS_SYSTOLOCAL is set, then the DDCAPS_CANBLTSYSMEM flag must be set by the driver and all the associated backing surface blt caps must be correct. DDCAPS2_SYSTONONLOCAL_AS_SYSTOLOCAL signifies that the backing surface to video memory DDCAPS blt caps also apply to backing surface to nonlocal video memory blts. For example, the <B>dwSVBCaps</B>, <B>dwSVBCKeyCaps</B>, <B>dwSVBFXCaps</B>, and <B>dwSVBRops</B> members of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_5xgn.htm">DDCORECAPS</A> structure are assumed to be filled in correctly. Any blt from a backing surface to nonlocal memory that matches these caps bits is passed to the driver. </P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This feature is intended to enable the driver itself to do efficient reordering of textures. This is <I>not</I> meant to imply that hardware can write into AGP memory. Hardware writing directly into AGP memory is not currently supported.</P>
