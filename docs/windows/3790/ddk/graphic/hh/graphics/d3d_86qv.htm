<H3><A NAME="ddk_render_target_requirements_gg"></A>Render Target Requirements</H3>

<P>The requirements for color buffers and depth buffers are as follows:</P>

<H4>Color Buffers</H4>

<P>If the hardware does not support a render target that is also to be used as a texture (that is, the device cannot “render to a texture”), the device must fail calls to the <B>IDirect3DDevice7::SetRenderTarget</B> and <B>IDirect3D7::CreateDevice</B> methods. These methods are described in the Direct3D SDK documentation. The fact that a render target is to be used as a texture is signified by the presence of the DDSCAPS_TEXTURE flag in the surface description (see the <B>dwCaps</B> member of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_6zhj.htm">DDSCAPS</A> structure).</P>

<H4>Depth Buffers</H4>

<P>If the hardware does not support a particular combination of render target and depth-buffers, then the device must fail API calls that cause this scenario when it detects mismatches of this sort, such as in calls to the <B>IDirect3D7::CreateDevice</B> and <B>IDirectDrawSurface7::AddAttachedSurface</B> methods. These methods are described in the Direct3D and DirectDraw SDK documentation sets, respectively. An example of such a mismatch might be when the render target and depth buffer are of different bit depths. Do not transparently alter the format of either the render target or the depth-buffer to cause an invalid combination to work properly. Instead, allocate a higher-precision depth buffer without informing the DirectX runtime.</P>
