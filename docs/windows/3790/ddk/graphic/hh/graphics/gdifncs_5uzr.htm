<P>The <B>EngAllocPrivateUserMem</B> function allocates a block of private user memory from the address space of a specified process, and inserts a caller-supplied tag before the allocation.</P>

<DL>

<DD>Pointer to the <A HREF="ddstrcts_1vl4.htm">DD_SURFACE_LOCAL</A> structure representing the DirectDraw surface with which to associate the allocated memory.</DD>

<DT><I>cj</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of bytes of memory to allocate.</DD>

<DT><I>tag</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies a 4-byte pool tag that uniquely identifies the driver doing the memory allocation. The values used for this parameter must be 7-bit ASCII characters.

<H4>Return Value</H4>

<P><B>EngAllocPrivateUserMem </B>returns a pointer to the allocated memory if there is enough user-mode memory to satisfy the request; otherwise, it returns a null pointer.</P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>A DirectDraw driver may require a user-memory "scratch pad" in place of true video memory. Although this practice is discouraged due to its performance implications, it is occasionally necessary. This scratch memory is usually allocated only for a short period of time. Once the memory has been allocated, it is used for the intended graphics operations, and then deallocated.</P>

<P>A problem arises if the driver instance is destroyed before the surface is unlocked. A particular case occurs when the system switches to a protected desktop as a result of a user pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. In this situation, the mode switch is performed on a system process context. If the driver has any outstanding surface locks, such as when the mode switch happens before the surface has been unlocked, the driver will be required to destroy that surface on a different process context. The driver cannot call <A HREF="gdifncs_6skn.htm"><B>EngFreeUserMem</B></A> to deallocate the scratch area since this entry point will fail if called on a different context from that used when the memory was allocated.</P>

<P><B>EngAllocPrivateUserMem</B>, and <A HREF="gdifncs_6yp3.htm"><B>EngFreePrivateUserMem</B></A> are provided to address this problem. These two functions are identical to <A HREF="gdifncs_4q7b.htm"><B>EngAllocUserMem</B></A> and <A HREF="gdifncs_6skn.htm"><B>EngFreeUserMem</B></A>, except that they do the extra work required to free memory allocated on a different process context. Process context information is stored with the DirectDraw object that owns the DirectDraw surface object to which <I>psl</I> points.</P>

<P>The <I>tag</I> string should be specified in byte-reversed order. The reason for this is that if a crash dump of the system occurs, the contents of the <I>tag</I> string are displayed in the opposite order. It is recommended that the first letter in the displayed string be 'D' to denote a display driver; the other three (at most) bytes should be indicative of the driver name. For example, the <I>tag</I> string '3sD' will appear as 'Ds3' if pool is dumped.</P>
