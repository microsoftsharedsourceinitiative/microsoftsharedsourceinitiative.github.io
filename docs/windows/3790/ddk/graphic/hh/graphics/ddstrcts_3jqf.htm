</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS2_HARDWAREDEINTERLACE</TD>
<TD width=52%>The driver must convert the interlaced signal to progressive frames. The DDSCAPS_VIDEOPORT and DDSCAPS_OVERLAY flags in this structure must also be set.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS2_HINTANTIALIASING</TD>
<TD width=52%>The application will use antialiasing. This flag is valid only if the DDSCAPS_3DDEVICE flag is also set.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS2_HINTDYNAMIC</TD>
<TD width=52%>The application will be updating the surface frequently. Surfaces with this flag set must also have the DDSCAPS_TEXTURE flag in this structure set. This flag cannot be used with the DDSCAPS2_HINTSTATIC or DDSCAPS2_OPAQUE flags.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS2_HINTSTATIC</TD>
<TD width=52%>The application will be updating the surface infrequently, but still requires access. Surfaces with this flag set must also have the DDSCAPS_TEXTURE flag in this structure set. This flag cannot be used with the DDSCAPS2_HINTDYNAMIC or DDSCAPS2_OPAQUE flags.</TD>

<P>Marks an index buffer, created and controlled by the application.</P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS2_MIPMAPSUBLEVEL</TD>
<TD width=52%>It enables easier use of <B>GetAttachedSurface</B>, rather than <B>EnumAttachedSurfaces</B>, for surface constructs such as cube maps, in which there is more than one mipmap surface attached to the root surface. This should be set on all non-top-level surfaces in a mipmapped cube map so that a call to <B>GetAttachedSurface</B> can distinguish between top-level faces and attached mipmap levels. This capability bit is ignored by <B>CreateSurface</B>.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS2_NOTUSERLOCKABLE</TD>
<TD width=52%><B>DirectX 8.0 and later versions only.</B>
<P>Set on the primary and the back buffers if the flipping chain is not lockable, or on any render target that is not lockable. This allows drivers to do behind the scenes optimization. Note that it is still possible to lock the surfaces so the driver must handle these cases, but such locks are infrequent and are not expected to be fast.<BR>
The driver can also determine whether the depth/stencil buffer is lockable by the presence of this flag. </P>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS2_NPATCHES</TD>

</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS2_OPAQUE</TD>
<TD width=52%>The application will never lock, blit, or update the surface for the rest of that surface's lifetime. The driver can compress or reorder the surface without ever having to decompress it. Surfaces with this flag set must also have the DDSCAPS_TEXTURE flag in this structure set. This flag cannot be used with the DDSCAPS2_HINTDYNAMIC or DDSCAPS2_HINTSTATIC flags.</TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS2_POINTS</TD>

</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS2_STEREOSURFACELEFT</TD>
<TD width=52%>This surface is part of a stereo flipping chain. When this flag is set during a <B>CreateSurface</B> call, a pair of stereo surfaces are created for each buffer in the primary flipping chain. You must create a complex flipping chain (with back buffers). You cannot create a single set of stereo surfaces. The <B>Flip</B> method requires back buffers, so at least 4 surfaces must be created.
<P>In addition, when this flag is set in a <A HREF="ddstrcts_2y7b.htm">DDSURFACEDESC</A> structure as the result of an <B>EnumDisplayModes</B> or <B>GetDisplayMode</B> call, it indicates support for stereo in that mode.</P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS2_TEXTUREMANAGE</TD>
<TD width=52%>The client indicates that this texture surface should be managed by the driver if possible; otherwise it is managed by Direct3D Immediate Mode. This flag can be used only for texture surfaces (DDSCAPS_TEXTURE flag set in the <B>dwCaps</B> member). For more information, see Automatic Texture Management in the Direct3D Immediate Mode documentation.</TD>

<TD width=52%>The first five bits of <B>dwCaps3</B> indicate the number of samples for a multiple-sampled surface.
