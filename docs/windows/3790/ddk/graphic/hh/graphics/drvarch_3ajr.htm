<P>To distinguish between color and noncolor (monochrome or grayscale) devices, Windows&nbsp;2000 and later NT-based operating system versions call the <A HREF="drvrfnc_8zhj.htm"><B>DrvDeviceCapabilities</B></A> function, passing the DC_COLORDEVICE constant in the call. This function returns 1 if the device supports color, and 0 if the device produces monochrome or grayscale output. It is recommended that all printer drivers support calls to <B>DrvDeviceCapabilities</B> for the DC_COLORDEVICE constant.</P>

<P>It is very important for drivers to implement the <B>DrvDeviceCapabilities</B> function. Otherwise it is more difficult for the operating system to distinguish between color and noncolor devices, for the following reasons:

<UL>
	<LI>A call to the <B>GetDeviceCaps</B> function (described in the Platform SDK documentation), in which the NUMCOLORS constant is passed, <I>usually</I> results in a return value less than or equal to 2 for most noncolor devices, and greater than 2 for color devices. The operating system is unable to distinguish between monochrome and grayscale devices. </LI>

	<LI>The value of the <B>dmColor</B> member of the <A HREF="grstrcts_6v8n.htm">DEVMODEW</A> structure is not a reliable indicator of whether the device is a color or noncolor device. Certain printer drivers set this member to DMCOLOR_COLOR even for devices that are not capable of producing color.</LI>
