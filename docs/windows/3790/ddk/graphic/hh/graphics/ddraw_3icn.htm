<P>To enable the extended surface alignment functionality, the DirectDraw driver must perform the following tasks at initialization time: 

<UL>
	<LI>The driver must specify a <A HREF="ddfncs_0yhz.htm"><I>DdGetDriverInfo</I></A> function in the <A HREF="ddstrcts_17s7.htm">DD_HALINFO</A> structure that DirectDraw can call to get additional information. </LI>

	<LI>The <I>DdGetDriverInfo</I> callback is called with the GUID_GetHeapAlignment GUID specified. The driver must fill in a <A HREF="ddstrcts_2ecn.htm">DD_GETHEAPALIGNMENTDATA</A> structure, then copy this structure to the <B>lpvData</B> member of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_3ijr.htm">DD_GETDRIVERINFODATA</A> structure. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The driver should fill in the <A HREF="ddstrcts_6zhj.htm">DDSCAPS</A> structure pointed to in the <A HREF="ddstrcts_4muf.htm">HEAPALIGNMENT</A> structure with the logical OR of the DDSCAPS_xxxx flags for any type of surface that requires alignment in this heap. If a bit in DDSCAPS is set, then DirectDraw abides by the alignment restrictions expressed in the appropriate <A HREF="grstrcts_46qv.htm">SURFACEALIGNMENT</A> structure member. The DDSCAPS_FLIP bit and the <B>FlipTarget</B> member apply to surfaces that are back buffers in the primary flipping chain, that is, a potentially primary (visible) surface. The following list shows the currently allowed set of surface capabilities for which alignment can be specified: 

<UL>
	<LI>DDSCAPS_OFFSCREENPLAIN </LI>

	<LI>DDSCAPS_EXECUTEBUFFER </LI>

	<LI>DDSCAPS_OVERLAY </LI>

	<LI>DDSCAPS_TEXTURE </LI>

	<LI>DDSCAPS_ZBUFFER </LI>

	<LI>DDSCAPS_ALPHA </LI>

	<LI>DDSCAPS_FLIP </LI>
</UL>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;DirectDraw compares a new surface's capabilities against the entries in the <A HREF="ddstrcts_4muf.htm">HEAPALIGNMENT</A> structure in the order in which they are specified. For example, a surface with DDSCAPS_MIPMAP | DDSCAPS_TEXTURE | DDSCAPS_FLIP set is aligned according to the <B>Texture</B> member of the HEAPALIGNMENT structure, because this is the first applicable capabilities bit for which an alignment is specified (that is, <B>Texture</B> appears before <B>FlipTarget</B> in the HEAPALIGNMENT structure). The <B>FlipTarget</B> member is not considered in this example. Because back buffers in a primary flipping chain are marked with DDSCAPS_FLIP and no other bit for which an alignment can be specified, such surfaces are aligned according to the <B>FlipTarget</B> member. Surfaces that could potentially become members of a primary flipping chain (those with the same pixel format and size as the primary surface) are also aligned according to the <B>FlipTarget</B> member. </P>
