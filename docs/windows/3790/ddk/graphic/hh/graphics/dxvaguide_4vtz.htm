<P>If the <B>bPicIntra</B> and the <B>bMV_RPS</B> members of <A HREF="dxvaref_9oyv.htm">DXVA_PictureParameters</A> are zero, the macroblock control command structure ends with the data described in <A HREF="dxvaguide_6h7r.htm">Third Part of Macroblock Control Command Structure</A>. The macroblock control command structure ends with the third part of the structure padded with zero-valued data, if necessary, to align the next macroblock control command to a 16-byte boundary.</P>

<P>If the <B>bPicIntra</B> member of DXVA_PictureParameters is zero and the <B>bMV_RPS</B> member of DXVA_PictureParameters is 1, the fourth part of the macroblock control command structure is an array of bytes called <I>bRefPicSelect</I>. The number of elements in that array is the same as the number of elements in the <B>MVector</B> array shown in the preceding table. Each element of the array specifies the index of the uncompressed surface associated with the corresponding motion vector found in the <B>MVector</B> array. Then, the macroblock control command structure ends and is padded with zero-valued data, if necessary, to align the next macroblock control command structure to a 16-byte boundary.</P>
