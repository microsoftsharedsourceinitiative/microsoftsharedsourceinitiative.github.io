<P>An OEM plug-in can notify the Pscript5 driver that the %<I>hostfont</I>%-ready PostScript interpreter has a set of fonts and CIDFonts that are available to use and are identical to those that the Pscript5 driver might download in the course of a print job. Notification of which fonts are to be handled this way is done by placing keys in the registry. The Pscript5 driver checks the registry for new information when its <A HREF="ddifncs_0zzb.htm"><B>DrvEnablePDEV</B></A> function is called. The plug-in can then ensure that the data is current before the PDEV is enabled. </P>

<P>The following table lists the %<I>hostfont</I>% registry entry names, their types, and their values. The OEM plug-in should call <B>SetPrinterData</B> (described in the Platform SDK documentation) to set these entry names. The <B>HostFont</B><I>Xxx</I> entry names are mutually exclusive. That is, only one of the following entry names can exist in the registry at any given time.</P>

<H4>Additional Notes on Hostfont Registry Entry Names</H4>

<P class=indent1><B>HostFontExceptFonts</B> is REG_BINARY data consisting of a sequence of NULL-terminated single-byte strings containing the PostScript <B>findfont</B> names of TTF-based, OTF-based, or PFB-based encoding-and-glyph-name-based fonts. The names are listed in no particular order; the last name is terminated by two NULLs, and there are no bytes after the NULLs. This entry name is checked only when <B>HostFontHasMostFonts</B> is not found.</P>

<P class=indent1>The existence of the <B>HostFontHasMostFonts</B> key with any value assigned to it means that the driver should assume that all TTF-based, OTF-based, and PFB-based host fonts are available in their "native" format, that is, as a PostScript font or a CIDFont format as appropriate, on the target interpreter.</P>

<P class=indent1><B>HostFontIncludesFonts</B> is similar to <B>HostFontExceptFonts</B> except that it explicitly lists PostScript font names that <I>are </I>available on the target interpreter.</P>
