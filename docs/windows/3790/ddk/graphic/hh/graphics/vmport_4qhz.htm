<P>The following are some of the requirements for video miniport drivers.

<UL>
	<LI><B>An NT-based operating system video miniport driver must be a single <I>.sys</I> file.</B>
<P>A miniport driver consists of a single binary file. The miniport driver's main purpose is to detect, initialize, and configure one or more graphics adapters of the same type.
</LI>

	<LI><B>A miniport driver can only make calls exported by <I>videoprt.sys</I>.</B>
<P>A miniport driver can call only those functions that are exported by the system-supplied video port driver. (The exported video port functions are listed on the reference pages following <A HREF="vpfncs_4gmf.htm">Video Port Functions for Miniport Drivers</A>.) Driver writers can also use the following to determine which functions a miniport driver is calling:

<PRE>link -dump -imports my_driver.sys</PRE>

<P>A miniport driver cannot load or install another driver on the machine using undocumented OS function calls.
</LI>

	<LI><B>A miniport driver can enable panning only upon receiving an end-user request.</B>
<P>Panning must be disabled by default. The miniport driver should enable it only when it is requested through a Control Panel. OEMs can enable panning by default as a part of their preinstall.
</LI>
</UL>
