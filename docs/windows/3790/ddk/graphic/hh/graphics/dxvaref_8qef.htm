<DD>Indicates that the deinterlace hardware can operate on a subrectangle region of the video image. This is useful if the video image needs to be cropped before being processed further as the size of the output frames is reduced.</DD>

<DT><B>DXVA_VideoProcess_YUV2RGB</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates that the deinterlace hardware can convert video from the YUV color space to the RGB color space. The RGB format used will have at least 8 bits of precision for each color component. If this is possible, a buffer copy within the VMR can be avoided. All drivers should be able to support this operation for the bob deinterlace mode. </DD>

<DT><B>DXVA_VideoProcess_StretchX</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates that aspect ratio correction can be performed at the same time as the video is being deinterlaced if the deinterlacer is able to stretch or shrink horizontally. This enumerator should be supported for the bob deinterlace mode.</DD>

<DT><B>DXVA_VideoProcess_StretchY</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates that aspect ratio adjustment is combined with a general picture resizing operation to scale the video image. </DD>

<DT><B>DXVA_VideoProcess_AlphaBlend</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates that the VMR will not perform a buffer copy when an alpha value is changed. It is rare that applications alter the constant alpha value associated with the video stream, so this is a low priority feature. This enumerator should be supported for the bob deinterlace mode.

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>Sometimes the aspect ratio adjustment performed by <B>DXVA_VideoProcess_AlphaBlend</B> is combined with a general picture resizing operation to scale the video image within an application-defined composition space. This is rare and not an essential feature. It is best if the scaling needed for resizing the video to fit into the application window can be done at the same time as the scaling needed for deinterlacing.  This avoids cumulative artifacts. </P>

<P>Color space conversion performed by <B>DXVA_VideoProcess_YUV2RGB</B> is particularly useful within the VMR if it can be combined with any (and ideally, all) of the following enumerators: <B>DXVA_VideoProcess_StretchX</B>, <B>DXVA_VideoProcess_StretchY</B>, and <B>DXVA_VideoProcess_AlphaBlend</B>. There is no requirement to convert from the RGB color space to the YUV color space.</P>
