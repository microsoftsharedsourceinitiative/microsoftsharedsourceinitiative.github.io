<P>When the DirectX runtime requests that a driver create a DXT<I>n</I> compressed texture surface whose width and height are less than 4x4, the driver actually allocates a 4x4 block of memory for the texture surface. However, the driver reports the width and height of the texture surface as the values that the runtime requested. For example, if a 2x2 DXT1 compressed texture surface is requested, the driver allocates a 4x4 block but reports that the block is 2x2 by leaving the requested texture size unchanged. To request a specific DXT<I>n</I> compressed texture size, the runtime sets the <B>dwWidth</B> and <B>dwHeight</B> members of a <A HREF="ddstrcts_2y7b.htm">DDSURFACEDESC</A> or <A HREF="ddstrcts_59k7.htm">DDSURFACEDESC2</A> structure that represents the texture surface. The driver does not alter these size settings even if it allocates a 4x4 texture surface when the request is for a texture surface whose width and height are less than 4x4. </P>
