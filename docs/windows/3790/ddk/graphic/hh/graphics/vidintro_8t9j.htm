<P>Fast User Switching, a feature of Windows&nbsp;XP and later, enables multiple users to be logged onto the same machine. A particular user's desktop and any running applications persist from that user's logon session to his or her next. </P>

<P>Fast User Switching works by allowing multiple virtual display drivers to run at the same time. (Each virtual display driver is associated with a particular PDEV.) The video miniport driver, however, exists as a single instance. When one of the virtual display drivers calls a video miniport driver callback, serious problems ensue if the miniport driver attempts to access a passed-in memory address in the context of the display driver when that display driver instance is no longer the active kernel thread. A tenet of the display driver/video miniport driver architecture is that information should flow in one direction only: from the display driver to the video miniport driver. </P>
