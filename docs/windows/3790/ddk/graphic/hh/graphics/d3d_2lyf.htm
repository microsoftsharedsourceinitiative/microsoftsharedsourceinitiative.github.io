<P>Before DirectX 8.0, vertex indices were restricted to 16-bit quantities. DirectX 8.0 adds support for 32-bit indices. A driver reports support for 32-bit indices by setting the value of the <B>MaxVertexIndex</B> field of D3DCAPS8 (currently also in <A HREF="d3dstrct_2zhj.htm">D3DHAL_D3DEXTENDEDCAPS</A>) to a value greater than 0xFFFF. This field also allows the driver to report that although it supports indices requiring 32-bits of storage it does not support the full range of 32-bit values.</P>

<P><B>DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.</B><BR>
In order for a driver to expose its Direct3D hardware abstraction layer (HAL) device to applications through DirectX 9.0 interfaces, the driver must set the value of <B>MaxVertexIndex</B> to a value greater than or equal to 0xFFFF.</P>
