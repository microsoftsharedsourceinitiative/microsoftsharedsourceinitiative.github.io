<H4>Members</H4>

<DL>
<DT><B>dwSize (Windows 98/Me only)</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the size of this structure. This member must be initialized before the structure is used.</DD>

<DT><B>lpDD</B> </DT>

<DD>Points to a <A HREF="ddstrcts_55lz.htm">DD_DIRECTDRAW_LOCAL</A> structure that describes the DirectDraw API.</DD>

<DT><B>lpDDSurface</B> </DT>

<DD>Points to the <A HREF="ddstrcts_1vl4.htm">DD_SURFACE_LOCAL</A> structure that describes the surface with which to sync. </DD>

<DT><B>dwSurfaceOffset</B> </DT>

<DD>Contains the byte offset from the start of the frame buffer to the start of the surface. This value is used only by the miniport. This member must contain data that is filled in by the driver. </DD>

<DT><B>fpLockPtr</B> </DT>

<DD>Contains the pointer value to be returned by the <A HREF="ddfncs_11gn.htm"><I>DdLock</I></A> call for accessing the surface. This value is used by a kernel-mode client. This member can be modified by the driver, but does not need to be. </DD>

<DT><B>lPitch</B> </DT>

<DD>Contains the pitch passed to the client during a <I>DdLock</I> call. This member can be modified by the driver, but does not need to be. </DD>

<DT><B>dwOverlayOffset</B> </DT>

<DD>Contains the byte offset from the start of the frame buffer to the start of the overlay. This value is used only by the miniport and may be different than the <B>dwSurfaceOffset</B> member if cropping is involved or if the overlay origin is not the top left of the surface. This member must contain data that is filled in by the driver. </DD>

<DT><B>dwOverlaySrcWidth (Windows 98/Me only)</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the source width of the overlay. This value is used only by the miniport. This member can be modified by the driver, but does not need to be.</DD>

<DT><B>dwOverlaySrcHeight (Windows 98/Me only)</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the source height of the overlay. This value is used only by the miniport. This member can be modified by the driver, but does not need to be.</DD>

<DT><B>dwOverlayDestWidth (Windows 98/Me only)</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the destination width of the overlay. This value is used only by the miniport. This member can be modified by the driver, but does not need to be.</DD>

<DT><B>dwOverlayDestHeight (Windows 98/Me only)</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the destination height of the overlay. This value is used only by the miniport. This member can be modified by the driver, but does not need to be.</DD>

<DT><B>dwDriverReserved1</B></DT>

<DD>Reserved for use by the display driver.</DD>

<DT><B>dwDriverReserved2</B></DT>

<DD>Reserved for use by the display driver.</DD>

<DT><B>dwDriverReserved3</B></DT>

<DD>Reserved for use by the display driver.</DD>

<DT><B>dwDriverReserved4 (Windows 2000 and later only)</B></DT>

<DD>Reserved for use by the display driver.</DD>

<DT><B>ddRVal</B> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the location in which the driver writes the return value of the <I>DdSyncSurfaceData</I> callback. A return code of DD_OK indicates success.
