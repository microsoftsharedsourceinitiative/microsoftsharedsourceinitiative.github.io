<P>The process for establishing the configuration for each DirectX VA function (a specific value of <A HREF="dxvaguide_9i5j.htm"><I>bDXVA_Func</I></A>) that needs a configuration (for example, compressed picture decoding, alpha-blending data loading, and alpha-blending combination) can be performed by: 

<OL>
	<LI>Probing (if needed) to determine whether a configuration is accepted by the accelerator.</LI>

	<LI>Locking<B> </B>in a specific configuration, if it is supported.</LI>
</OL>

<P>To determine if a specific configuration is supported, a probing command is sent to the accelerator for the particular <I>bDXVA_Func</I> value to be probed, along with a configuration. In addition to the probing command, a configuration structure (for the value in <I>bDXVA_Func</I>) is sent that describes the configuration being probed to determine whether the configuration is supported. The accelerator then returns a value of S_OK or S_FALSE, indicating whether the specified configuration is supported by the accelerator. The accelerator can also return a suggested alternative configuration.</P>

<P>To lock in a specific configuration, a locking command is sent to the accelerator for the particular <I>bDXVA_Func</I> to be locked. Along with the locking command, a configuration structure (for the value in <I>bDXVA_Func</I>) is sent that describes the configuration to be locked in, if the configuration is supported. The accelerator returns an S_OK or S_FALSE indicating whether the specified configuration is supported by the accelerator. If the return value is S_OK, the specified configuration is locked in for use. If the return value is S_FALSE, a suggested alternative configuration is returned.</P>

<P>The decoder may send a locking command without first sending a probing command for the specified configuration. If the accelerator returns an S_OK in a probing command for a specific configuration, it returns an S_OK to a locking command for that same configuration, unless otherwise noted. After a locking command has been sent and the accelerator returns S_OK, the specified configuration is locked in and no additional probing or locking commands are sent by the decoder for the same value of <I>bDXVA_Func</I>.</P>

<P>To ensure that all DirectX VA software decoders can operate with all DirectX VA accelerators, a <A HREF="dxvaguide_6trb.htm"><I>minimal interoperability configuration set</I></A> is defined as a set of configurations that must be supported by any decoder using a particular value for <I>bDXVA_Func</I>. Every accelerator that indicates support for the <I>bDXVA_Func</I> variable by exposing an associated video accelerator GUID must support at least one member of this interoperability configuration set. In some cases, an <A HREF="dxvaguide_6dk7.htm"><I>additional encouraged configuration set</I></A> may also be defined.</P>

<P>The following figure shows the control flow of probing and locking commands sent by the decoder:</P>
