<P>An important change to the Direct3D DDI, introduced in DirectX 7.0, is that textures are blitted by embedding a token in the <A HREF="d3dfncs_5usn.htm"><I>D3dDrawPrimitives2</I></A> command stream. This token is <A HREF="d3denum_0jon.htm#ddk_d3ddp2op_texblt_gg">D3DDP2OP_TEXBLT</A>, and it signals the driver that a texture has to be transferred from a backing surface into local or nonlocal video memory. </P>

<P>Also, instead of the driver being responsible for creating internal handles for textures through the legacy <I>D3dTextureCreate</I> and <I>D3dTextureDestroy</I> callbacks, the runtime now assigns a handle number to each DirectDrawSurface object that is created within the Direct3D context. The driver is signaled about this handle number through the <A HREF="d3dfncs_0gtj.htm"><I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I></A> callback. </P>

<P><I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I> is called after every hardware abstraction layer (HAL) <A HREF="ddfncs_6bdz.htm"><I>DDCreateSurface</I></A> call is finished. <I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I> is also called after every internal hardware emulation layer (HEL) <B>CreateSurface</B> call is finished. The HEL call usually occurs when a backing DirectDrawSurface object is created. These calls may occur before and after a Direct3D context is created with <A HREF="d3dfncs_39yf.htm"><I>D3dContextCreate</I></A>. </P>

<P>Also, when the application is running, a call is made to <A HREF="d3dfncs_3mw7.htm"><I>D3dDestroyDDLocal</I></A> to clean up and destroy any driver data created explicitly for these surfaces. This call is also made before a Direct3D context is created. This is done to ensure that there are no dirty handles associated with any contexts that have not been cleaned up. This is simply a preventative measure that should not actually destroy anything if contexts are properly cleaned up after use.</P>
