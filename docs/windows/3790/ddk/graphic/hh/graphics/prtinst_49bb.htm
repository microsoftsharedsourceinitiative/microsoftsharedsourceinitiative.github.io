<P>You can optionally supply a special <I>Point and Print DLL</I> by associating its name with the <B>Module</B> registry value. This DLL must export the following two functions:

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="poprfnc_1cmf.htm"><B>GenerateCopyFilePaths</B></A></DT>

<DD>This function, which is called by both the server’s spooler and the client’s spooler, can be used to modify the directory path specified by the <B>Directory</B> registry value. Either the source path (on the server) or the destination path (on the client), or both, can be modified.</DD>

<DT><A HREF="poprfnc_5xnr.htm"><B>SpoolerCopyFileEvent</B></A></DT>

<DD>This function, also called by both the server’s spooler and the client’s spooler, receives an event code indicating the occurrence of certain connection-related printer events.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>A Point and Print DLL need not export <I>only</I> these functions. For example <I>mscms.dll</I>, which is used by Microsoft’s ICM component, also exports a set of ICM API functions.</P>

<P>Note that you can specify other DLLs in addition to, or instead of, a Point and Print DLL that exports <B>GenerateCopyFilePaths</B> and <B>SpoolerCopyFileEvent</B>. To do so, assign the DLL file names to the <B>Files</B> registry key instead of the <B>Module</B> registry key. (See <A HREF="prtinst_9fon.htm">Installing Queue-Specific Files</A>).</P>

<P>On the print server, the Point and Print DLL must be located in one of the load paths searched by the Platform SDK <B>LoadLibrary</B> function.</P>

<P>After the installation application has placed the DLL’s name in the server’s registry by calling <B>SetPrinterDataEx</B>, all subsequent calls to <B>SetPrinterDataEx</B> result in a call to the DLL’s <A HREF="poprfnc_5xnr.htm"><B>SpoolerCopyFileEvent</B></A> function, with a supplied event code of COPYFILE_EVENT_SET_PRINTER_DATAEX.</P>

<P>Unlike the files listed under the <B>Files</B> registry key (see <A HREF="prtinst_9fon.htm">Installing Queue-Specific Files</A>), the Point and Print DLL is <I>not</I> copied from the print server to the client when the client connects to a printer. Instead, the DLL is assumed to already be client-resident when a connection to the print server is made. As a result, the DLL can be used for additional purposes not related to Point and Print functionality.</P>

<P>When determining if the DLL named under the <B>Module</B> key can be found, the client spooler checks the <B>LoadLibrary</B> path and then checks the driver directory. One method for installing the Point and Print DLL on a client is to specify its name in a <A HREF="prtinst_0xbb.htm">printer INF file</A> as a dependent file, so the file can be copied to the client’s driver directory during <A HREF="prtinst_9qg7.htm">downloading of driver-specific files</A>.</P>
