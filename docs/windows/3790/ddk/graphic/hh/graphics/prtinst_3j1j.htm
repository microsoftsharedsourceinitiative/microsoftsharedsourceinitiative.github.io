<P><I>Point and Print</I> is a term that refers to the capability of allowing a user on a Windows&nbsp;2000 and later client to create a connection to a remote printer without providing disks or other installation media. All necessary files and configuration information are automatically downloaded from the print server to the client.</P>

<P>Point and Print technology provides two methods by which you can specify files that should be sent from the print server to the client machine:

<UL>
	<LI>Files can be associated with a printer driver. These files are associated with every print queue that uses the driver.</LI>

	<LI>Files can be associated with individual print queues.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For more information, see <A HREF="prtinst_0js7.htm">Supporting Point and Print During Printer Installations</A>.</P>

<P>When a user application calls the <B>AddPrinterConnection</B> function (described in the Platform SDK documentation) to make a printer connection, the following operations are performed:

<UL>
	<LI>Driver-associated and queue-associated files are downloaded from the print server to the client.</LI>

	<LI>Current values of the printer’s configuration parameters, which are stored in the server’s registry under the printer’s key, are downloaded to the client.</LI>
</UL>
