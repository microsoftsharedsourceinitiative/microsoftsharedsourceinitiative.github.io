<H4><A NAME="ddk_second_part_of_macroblock_control_command_structure_gg"></A>Second Part of Macroblock Control Command Structure</H4>

<P>The second part of a generic macroblock control command structure contains three variations, depending on the configuration of the picture decoding process:

<OL>
	<LI>If <I>HostResidDiff </I>(bit 11 in the <B>wMBtype</B> member) is equal to 1, the next element of the macroblock control command is <B>wPC_Overflow</B>. The <B>wPC_Overflow</B> member, if used, specifies which blocks of the macroblock use overflow residual difference data. <B>wPC_Overflow</B> is followed by a DWORD equal to zero.</LI>

	<LI>If <I>HostResidDiff</I> (bit 11 in the <B>wMBtype</B> member) is equal to zero and the <B>bChromaFormat</B> member of <A HREF="dxvaref_9oyv.htm">DXVA_PictureParameters</A> is equal to 1, the next element of the macroblock control command is <B>bNumCoef, </B>a six-element array of bytes. The <B>bNumCoef</B> member indicates the number of coefficients in the residual difference data buffer for each block of the macroblock.</LI>

	<LI>If <I>HostResidDiff</I> (bit 11 in the <B>wMBtype</B> element) is equal to zero and the <B>bChromaFormat</B> member of DXVA_PictureParameters is not equal to 1, the next element of the macroblock control command is <B>wTotalNumCoef</B>. This is followed by a DWORD equal to zero.</LI>
</OL>

<H4>wPC_Overflow</H4>

<P>The <B>wPC_Overflow</B> structure member specifies which blocks of the macroblock use overflow residual difference data.</P>

<P>When using host-based residual difference decoding (when <I>HostResidDiff</I> is equal to 1) with the <B>bPicOverflowBlocks</B> member of <A HREF="dxvaref_9oyv.htm">DXVA_PictureParameters</A> equal to 1 and <I>IntraMacroblock </I>equal to zero (the 8-8 overflow method), <B>wPC_Overflow</B> contains the pattern code of the overflow blocks specified in the same manner as <B>wPatternCode</B>. The data for the coded overflow blocks (those blocks having bit 11 minus <I>i</I> equal to 1) is found in the residual coding buffer in the same indexing order (increasing <I>i</I>).</P>

<H4>bNumCoef</H4>

<P>The <B>bNumCoef</B> structure member is an array of six elements. The <I>i</I>th element of the <B>bNumCoef</B> array contains the number of coefficients in the residual difference data buffer for each block <I>i</I> of the macroblock, where <I>i</I> is the index of the block within the macroblock as specified in MPEG-2 video Figures 6-10, 6-11, and 6-12 (raster-scan order for Y, followed by Cb, followed by Cr). <B>bNumCoef</B> is used only when <I>HostResidDiff</I> is zero and the <B>bChromaFormat</B> member of <A HREF="dxvaref_9oyv.htm">DXVA_PictureParameters</A> is 1 (4:2:0). If used in 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 formats, it will increase the size of typical macroblock control commands past a critical memory alignment boundary, so only an EOB within the transform coefficient structure is used for determining the number of coefficients in each block in non-4:2:0 cases. The purpose of <B>bNumCoef</B> is to indicate the quantity of data present for each block in the residual difference data buffer, expressed as the number of coefficients present. When the <B>bConfig4GroupedCoefs</B> member of <A HREF="dxvaref_3vdz.htm">DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode</A> is 1, <B>bNumCoef</B> may contain either the actual number of coefficients sent for the block or that value rounded up to be a multiple of four. The data for these coefficients is found in the residual difference buffer in the same order.</P>

<H4>wTotalNumCoef</H4>

<P>The <B>wTotalNumCoef</B> structure member indicates the total number of coefficients in the residual difference data buffer for the entire macroblock. This member is used only when <I>HostResidDiff</I> is zero and the <B>bChromaFormat</B> member of <A HREF="dxvaref_9oyv.htm">DXVA_PictureParameters</A> is not equal to 1 (4:2:0).</P>
