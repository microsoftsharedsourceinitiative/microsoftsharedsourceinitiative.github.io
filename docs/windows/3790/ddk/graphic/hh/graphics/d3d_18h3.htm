<P>When a complex primary surface is created, it might or might not have an attached Z-buffer. When a surface is restored, it is possible that the application has added an attachment to a Z-buffer. Driver writers should be aware of these different scenarios when going through surface attachment lists in <A HREF="d3dfncs_0gtj.htm"><I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I></A>. </P>

<P>A typical technique, presented in the <I>perm3</I> sample driver, is to mark a surface’s <B>dwReserved1</B> field when <I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I> is called for that surface. The driver only marks the surface if <B>fpVidMem</B> (a member of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_392f.htm">DD_SURFACE_GLOBAL</A> structure) is not equal to zero. This is because <B>fpVidMem</B> could be zero because the application restored a primary surface that had a back buffer with an explicitly attached Z-buffer, but the Z-buffer had not yet been restored. At some later time, the application restores the Z-buffer, and the driver then marks it. If the application restores the Z-buffer before restoring the primary chain, the driver may receive the Z-buffer, already marked, attached to the back buffer when <I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I> is called.</P>
