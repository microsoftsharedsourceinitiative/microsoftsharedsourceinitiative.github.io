<P>A driver reports its support for high order surfaces using four new capability bits in the <B>DevCaps</B> field of the D3DCAPS8 structure. These flags are as follows:</P>

<H4>D3DDEVCAPS_QUINTICRTPATCHES</H4>

<P>Device supports quintic béziers and B-splines.</P>

<H4>D3DDEVCAPS_RTPATCHES</H4>

<P>Device supports rectangular and triangular patches.</P>

<H4>D3DDEVCAPS_RTPATCHHANDLEZERO</H4>

<P>When this device capability is set, the hardware architecture does not require caching of any information and that uncached patches (handle zero) are drawn as efficiently as cached ones. Note that D3DDEVCAPS_RPATCHHANDLERZERO does not mean that a patch with handle zero can be drawn. A handle zero patch can always be drawn whether this cap is set or not.</P>

<H4>D3DDEVCAPS_NPATCHES</H4>

<P>Device supports n-patches.</P>
