<P>All Direct3D drivers must support <I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I>.</P>

<P><I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I> creates an association between a DirectDraw surface and a small integer surface handle. By creating these associations between a handle and a DirectDraw surface, <I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I> allows a surface handle to be embedded in the Direct3D command stream. For example, when the <A HREF="d3denum_0jon.htm#ddk_d3ddp2op_texblt_gg">D3DDP2OP_TEXBLT</A> command token is sent to the driver's <A HREF="d3dfncs_5usn.htm"><I>D3dDrawPrimitives2</I></A> function to load a texture map, it uses a source handle and destination handle that were associated with a DirectDraw surface through <I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I>. </P>

<P>For every DirectDraw surface created under the local DirectDraw object, the runtime generates a valid handle that uniquely identifies the surface and places the handle in the <B>dwSurfaceHandle</B> member of a <A HREF="ddstrcts_3esn.htm">DD_SURFACE_MORE</A> structure. The <B>lpDDSLcl</B> member of the DD_CREATESURFACEEXDATA structure at <I>pcsxd</I> points to a <A HREF="ddstrcts_1vl4.htm">DD_SURFACE_LOCAL</A> structure that contains a <B>lpSurfMore</B> member that points to this DD_SURFACE_MORE. This handle value is also used with the D3DRENDERSTATE_TEXTUREHANDLE render state to enable texturing, and with the <A HREF="d3denum_0jon.htm#ddk_d3ddp2op_setrendertarget_gg">D3DDP2OP_SETRENDERTARGET</A> and <A HREF="d3denum_0jon.htm#ddk_d3ddp2op_clear_gg">D3DDP2OP_CLEAR</A> commands to set and clear new rendering and depth buffers. The driver should fail the call and return DDHAL_DRIVER_HANDLED if it cannot create the Direct3D surface.</P>

<P>For either a system memory surface or video memory surface, when <I>D3DCreateSurfaceEx</I> is called to notify about the association of <B>dwSurfaceHandle</B> with the surface’s <A HREF="ddstrcts_392f.htm">DD_SURFACE_GLOBAL</A> and <A HREF="ddstrcts_1vl4.htm">DD_SURFACE_LOCAL</A> structures, the display driver can store any data (for example, a pointer to privately allocated memory) in the <B>dwReserved1</B> members of DD_SURFACE_GLOBAL and DD_SURFACE_LOCAL because these members are reserved for private use by the display driver. </P>

<P>To notify the display driver that a system memory surface is to be released, the runtime sets the <B>fpVidMem</B> pointer member of the system memory surface's DD_SURFACE_GLOBAL structure to zero and calls the display driver's <I>D3DCreateSurfaceEx</I> callback. In addition to releasing all resources associated with this surface, the display driver must clear out the data that was previously stored in the <B>dwReserved1</B> members. Note that because the <B>fpVidMem</B> pointer member for a video memory surface can be set to zero, the display driver must verify whether the surface is in video or system memory to determine if the call to <I>D3DCreateSurfaceEx</I> is meant to notify about the association of a video memory surface with <B>dwSurfaceHandle</B> or to notify about the disassociation of a system memory surface from <B>dwSurfaceHandle</B>.</P>

<P><I>D3DCreateSurfaceEx</I> is not called to notify about the disassociation of a video memory surface from <B>dwSurfaceHandle</B>; the display driver's <A HREF="ddfncs_1c4n.htm"><I>DdDestroySurface</I></A> callback must handle local and non-local video memory surface deletion and must clear out data that was previously stored in the <B>dwReserved1</B> members.</P>

<P>The driver should also store any surface-related information that it  needs when using the surface. The driver must create a new surface table for each new <B>lpDDLcl</B> and implicitly enlarge the table when necessary to accommodate more surfaces. Typically, this is done with an exponential growth algorithm so that you do not have to enlarge the table too often. See the <I>perm3</I> sample driver that ships with the DDK for implementation details.</P>

<P>Direct3D calls <I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I> after the surface is created by DirectDraw by request of the Direct3D runtime or the application.</P>

<P><I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I> can only be called with a disabled <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">PDEV</A> for a system memory surface. A PDEV is disabled or enabled by calling the display driver's <A HREF="ddifncs_00pz.htm"><I>DrvAssertMode</I></A> function. See <A HREF="ddraw_2izr.htm">Managing PDEVs</A> for more information. </P>
