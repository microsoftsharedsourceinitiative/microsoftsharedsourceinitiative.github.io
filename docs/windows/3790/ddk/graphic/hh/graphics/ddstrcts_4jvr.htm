<P class=note>The DD_MORESURFACECAPS structure defines more driver surface capabilities in addition to those described in <A HREF="ddstrcts_5xgn.htm">DDCORECAPS</A>.</P>

<PRE class=syntax>typedef struct _DD_MORESURFACECAPS {
    DWORD  dwSize;

<H4>Members</H4>

<DL>
<DT><B>dwSize</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the size of this DD_MORESURFACECAPS structure. The DD_MORESURFACECAPS structure is of variable size. There should be exactly <B>DD_HALINFO.vmiData.dwNumHeaps</B> copies of the <B>ddsExtendedHeapRestrictions</B> structure within the array member of this structure. The total size of a DD_MORESURFACECAPS structure is thus: 

<PRE>dwSize = 
   sizeof(DD_MORESURFACECAPS) +
   (DD_HALINFO.vmiData.dwNumHeaps - 1) * sizeof(DDSCAPSEX) * 2</PRE>


<P>This calculation accounts for the minimum size of the DD_MORESURFACECAPS structure, which includes only one <B>ddsExtendedHeapRestrictions</B> array element. Any additional <B>ddsExtendedHeapRestrictions</B> array elements must be accounted for by adding the sizes of the remaining array elements. That is, by adding the product of the number of remaining <B>ddsExtendedHeapRestrictions</B> structures times the size of each one.
</DD>

<DT><B>ddsCapsMore</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the extensions to <B>ddcaps.ddsCaps</B> that describe the types of extended surfaces the driver can create. When a DDCAPS structure is returned to the application, it is a <A HREF="ddstrcts_3jqf.htm">DDSCAPS2</A> structure manufactured from <B>DDCAPS.ddsCaps</B> and <B>DD_MORESURFACECAPS.ddsCapsMore</B>. </DD>

<DT><B>ddsExtendedHeapRestrictions</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies a structure containing two members. These members are filled in by DirectX 6.0-aware drivers (and drivers compliant with later versions of DirectX), to restrict the video memory heaps that are exposed to DirectDraw to certain sets of DDSCAPS_<I>Xxx</I> bits. The DirectDraw version is determined by looking at DDVERSIONINFO, which is defined in <I>ddrawi.h</I>. The <B>ddsCapsEx</B> and <B>ddsCapsExAlt</B> members of the DD_MORESURFACECAPS structure are exactly analogous to the <B>ddsCaps</B> and <B>ddsCapsAlt</B> members of the VIDEOMEMORY structures listed in the <B>VIDMEMINFO.pvmList</B> member of <B>DD_HALINFO.vmiData</B>. </DD>

<DT><B>ddsCapsEx</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies a DDSCAPS structure in which the driver returns the capabilities for which this chunk of memory cannot be used.</DD>

<DT><B>ddsCapsExAlt</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies a DDSCAPS structure in which the driver returns the capabilities for which this chunk of memory cannot be used for when no other memory is found on the first pass.
</DD>

<H4>Headers</H4>

<P>Defined in <I>ddrawint.h</I>. Include <I>winddi.h</I>.</P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>This structure contains the caps bits added to the <B>DDCAPS.ddsCaps</B> structure in DirectX 6.0. See the DirectDraw SDK documentation for a description of the DDCAPS structure.</P>

<P><B>Note for Windows 98/Me:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;DD_MORESURFACECAPS is the definition for Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions. Drivers that run on Windows&nbsp;98/Me use the name DDMORESURFACECAPS, which is aliased in <I>dx95type.h</I>.</P>
