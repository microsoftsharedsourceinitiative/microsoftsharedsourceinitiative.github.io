<DT><B>dwXAlignment</B></DT>

<DD>Is the X alignment multiple in bytes that DirectDraw should respect when performing rectangular heap allocations. The driver cannot specify an X alignment that is more fine-grained than one doubleword; DirectDraw will round any X alignment up to the nearest multiple of 4 bytes. The driver should set this member to zero if no particular alignment is required.</DD>

<DT><B>dwYAlignment</B></DT>

<DD>Is the Y alignment multiple in bytes that DirectDraw should respect when performing rectangular heap allocations. The driver should set this member to zero if no particular alignment is required.</DD>

<DT><B>dwReserved1</B>, <B>dwReserved2</B></DT>

<DD>Are reserved for system use and should be ignored by the display driver.</DD>

<DT><B>Rectangular</B></DT>

<DD>Is a structure that describes the alignment restrictions for rectangular heap allocations. It contains the previously listed four members.
