<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>When <B>DrvUpgradePrinter</B> is called with its <I>pDriverUpgradeInfo</I> parameter pointing to a DRIVER_UPGRADE_INFO_2 structure, the <B>pPrinterName</B> member points to a string containing the name of the printer to be updated. The <B>pName</B> member points to a string containing the name of the printer driver to be updated, which is not necessarily the driver for the printer whose name is pointed to by the <B>pPrinterName</B> member. </P>

<P>To see how this can occur, suppose that a computer is connected to two printers, one whose driver is named "Acme Plotter," and the other whose driver is named "Acme RasterMaster." Suppose also that both drivers share a common driver file, <I>plotui.dll</I>. When the "Acme Plotter" driver is updated by a call to the <B>AddPrinterDriverEx</B> function (described in the Platform SDK documentation), <B>DrvUpgradePrinter</B> is called for both printers, because both drivers use files affected by the upgrade. In both calls, the <B>pName</B> member points to "Acme Plotter," the name of the printer driver used in the call to <B>AddPrinterDriverEx</B>. The string pointed to by the <B>pPrinterName</B> member is different in both calls to <B>DrvUpgradePrinter</B>, however. In each call, <B>pPrinterName</B> points to the name of the printer being updated.</P>
