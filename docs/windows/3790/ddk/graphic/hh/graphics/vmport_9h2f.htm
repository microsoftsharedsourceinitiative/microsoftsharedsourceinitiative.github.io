<P>As already mentioned in <A HREF="vmport_3eef.htm">VGA-Compatible Miniport's <I>HwVidFindAdapter</I></A>, the IOPM set for directly accessible I/O ports usually includes all SVGA registers except the sequencer registers and the miscellaneous output register, which the VGA-compatible miniport driver continues to monitor with its <I>SvgaHwIoPortXxx</I> functions. The sequencer registers control internal chip timing on VGA-compatible video adapters. If a full-screen MS-DOS application touches other adapter registers during a synchronous reset, the machine can hang. Likewise, if the miscellaneous output register is set to select a nonexistent clock, the machine can hang.</P>

<P>VGA-compatible miniport drivers must ensure that full-screen MS-DOS applications do not issue instructions that cause the machine to hang. Each such miniport driver must supply <I>SvgaHwIoPortXxx</I> functions that monitor application-issued instructions to the I/O ports for the adapter sequencer registers and miscellaneous output register. Each new VGA-compatible miniport driver for an adapter with special features also must monitor and continue to validate any I/O ports to which an application might send any instruction sequence that could hang the machine.</P>

<P>Whenever an application attempts to access the sequencer clock register, the <I>SvgaHwIoPortXxx</I> function must change the IOPM in order to trap all instructions coming in during a synchronous reset. As soon as an application sends an instruction that affects the sequencer or attempts to write to the miscellaneous output register, the <I>SvgaHwIoPortXxx</I> function should adjust the IOPM by calling <A HREF="vpfncs_15ev.htm"><B>VideoPortSetTrappedEmulatorPorts</B></A> to disable direct access to all adapter registers.</P>

<P>The miniport driver-supplied <I>SvgaHwIoPortXxx</I> functions should buffer subsequent <B>IN</B> (or <B>INSB/INSW/INSD</B>) and/or <B>OUT</B> (or <B>OUTSB/OUTSW/OUTSD</B>) instructions in the <B>EmulatorAccessEntriesContext</B> area it set up in the VIDEO_PORT_CONFIG_INFO (see <A HREF="vmport_3eef.htm">VGA-Compatible Miniport's <I>HwVidFindAdapter</I></A>) until the synchronous reset is done, or until the application either restores the miscellaneous output register or resets it to a "safe" clock.</P>

<P>Then, the miniport driver is responsible for checking that the buffered instructions cannot hang the machine. If not, the miniport driver should process the buffered instructions, usually by calling <A HREF="vpfncs_3huv.htm"><B>VideoPortSynchronizeExecution</B></A> with a driver-supplied <A HREF="vmpfncs_386f.htm"><I>HwVidSynchronizeExecutionCallback</I></A> function. Otherwise, the miniport driver should discard the buffered instructions.</P>
