<P>Traditional analog halftoning uses a halftoning screen, composed of cells of equal sizes, with fixed-cell spacing center-to-center. The fixed-cell spacing accommodates the thickness of the ink, while the size of a dot within each cell can vary to produce the impression of a continuous tone.</P>

<P>On a computer, most printing or screen shading also uses a fixed-cell pixel size. To simulate the variable dot size, a combination of cluster pixels simulates the halftone screen. GDI includes halftoning default parameters that provide a good first approximation. Additional device-specific information can be added to the system to improve output.</P>

<P>The driver sends GDI the device-related specifications that GDI needs to do halftoning through the <A HREF="grstrcts_2k9z.htm">GDIINFO</A> structure returned by the <A HREF="ddifncs_0zzb.htm"><I>DrvEnablePDEV</I></A> function. The driver specifies the pattern size with the <B>ulHTPatternSize</B> member of GDIINFO, which defines the preferred output format for halftoning. For specific devices, halftoning relates to the halftone pattern sizes. GDI provides numerous predefined pattern sizes from 2 x 2 through 16 x 16.</P>

<P>For each standard pattern size, there is also a modified version. It is identified by the suffix “_M” on the standard pattern size’s name. For example, the defined name of the standard 6-by-6 pattern is HT_PATSIZE_6x6, while the name of the modified 6-by-6 pattern is HT_PATSIZE_6x6_M). The modified version gives more color resolution, but can produce a side effect of horizontal or vertical noise. In addition, because each of these pattern sizes is device resolution-dependent, the appropriate pattern size depends upon the specific device.</P>

<P>The tradeoff between pattern size (spatial resolution) and color resolution is determined by the pattern size. A larger halftone pattern produces better color resolution, while a smaller pattern results in the best spatial resolution. Determining the best pattern size is frequently a matter of trial and error. For more information, refer to <A HREF="grstrcts_2k9z.htm">GDIINFO</A>.</P>

<P>Another of the GDIINFO structure members affecting halftoning is <B>flHTFlags</B>, which contains flags that describe the device resolution needed for halftoning.</P>

<P>GDI handles color adjustment requests from the application and passes the information down to driver functions through the graphics DDI. If the application selects halftoning and the surface is a standard format <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">DIB</A>, GDI processes the bitmap using its halftoning capabilities, after which, the bitmap is sent to the device. In the PostScript driver, the <A HREF="gdifncs_0bs7.htm"><B>EngStretchBlt</B></A> function can send the bitmap to the printer using either the <A HREF="ddifncs_27mv.htm"><I>DrvCopyBits</I></A> or <A HREF="ddifncs_8z3b.htm"><I>DrvBitBlt</I></A> (in the SRCCOPY mode) functions.</P>

<P>Letting GDI perform the halftoning instead of the PostScript printer, for example, provides a faster output with better WYSIWYG quality. An interface to the PostScript driver allows the user to adjust the halftoning and provides a checkbox to turn off GDI halftoning if the printer’s built-in halftoning capabilities are preferred.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="ddifncs_87mv.htm"><I>DrvDitherColor</I></A> function can return the DCR_HALFTONE value, which requests that GDI approximate a color using the existing device (halftone) palette. DCR_HALFTONE can be used with a display driver only when the device contains a device (halftone) palette, such as a VGA-16 adapter card, because it has a standard fixed palette. Monochrome drivers, including most raster printers, can use the <I>iMode</I> parameter in <I>DrvDitherColor</I> to obtain good gray-scale effects.</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 and later do not support halftoning on 24-bit (or higher) devices.</P>
