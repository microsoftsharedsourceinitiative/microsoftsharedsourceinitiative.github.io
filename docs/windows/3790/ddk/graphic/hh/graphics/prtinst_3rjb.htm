<P>The Printer device setup class is unique among device classes in its ability to accommodate drivers written for different processor architectures. For example, an x86 printer driver (one consisting of x86 binaries) can be installed on an Itanium-based machine, which is currently not possible for other device classes. </P>

<P>An x86 printer driver installed on an Itanium-based machine (with or without an Itanium printer driver already installed on it) is referred to in this topic as an <I>additional driver</I>. Similarly, an Itanium printer driver installed as a second printer driver on an x86-based machine is also referred to as an additional driver.</P>

<P>Note that an x86 printer driver that is installed as an additional printer driver on an Itanium machine is never executed on this machine. Its only purpose is to support Point and Print for x86 clients. The same is true for an Itanium printer driver installed on an x86-based machine. For information about Point and Print, see <A HREF="prtinst_3j1j.htm">Introduction to Point and Print</A>.</P>

<H4>Decorated INF <I>DDInstall</I> Sections Used to Install Additional Printer Drivers </H4>

<P>Because of the need to install printer drivers for different platforms, the printer class installer treats decorations in <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">INF <I>DDInstall</I> sections</A> differently for additional printer driver installations, compared to <I>native driver</I> installations (that is, installations of x86 drivers on x86-based machines, or of Itanium drivers on Itanium-based machines).</P>

<P>Unlike decorations in the <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_2.Click()">INF <B>Manufacturer</B> section</A> and in the <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_3.Click()">INF <I>Models</I> section</A>, which pertain to the processor architecture and the operating system version of the machine on which Setup is running, decorations in INF <I>DDInstall</I> sections pertain to the platform of the <I>driver</I> (the platform the printer driver targets) when an additional printer driver is installed. </P>

<P>Note that the preceding discussion applies to Windows Server&nbsp;2003 and later. On Windows&nbsp;XP and earlier, the printer class installer handles decorations in the INF <I>DDInstall</I> section differently than the way described in the previous paragraph when an additional printer driver is installed. For these operating system versions, decorations in the INF <I>DDInstall</I> section pertain to the machine on which Setup is running. Because of the different ways that decorations in the INF <I>DDInstall</I> section are treated in Windows&nbsp;XP and earlier<I> versus</I> Windows Server&nbsp;2003, you should include two different INF <I>Models</I> sections in your INF file if you intend to support the installation of additional printer drivers in both scenarios. (However, keep in mind that Windows&nbsp;XP is not a server version and hence can be used as a print server only in limited circumstances.)</P>

<P>The following example shows three different INF <I>DDInstall</I> sections. The first INF <I>DDInstall</I> section is used to install a driver of either type (x86 or Itanium) on a machine running Windows&nbsp;XP. The second INF <I>DDInstall</I> section is used to install an x86 driver on a machine running Windows Server&nbsp;2003. The third INF <I>DDInstall</I> section is used to install an Itanium driver on a machine running Windows Server&nbsp;2003.</P>

<P>In the preceding example, when Setup installs an x86 driver on a machine running Windows Server&nbsp;2003, the relevant INF <I>Models </I>section is the <B>[Acme.NT.5.2]</B> section. The <I>install-section-name</I> that appears in this section, <B>Acme100.PPD</B>, resolves in this case to the <B>[Acme100.PPD.NTx86]</B> <I>DDInstall</I> section. On the other hand, if an Itanium-based driver were being installed on a machine running Windows Server&nbsp;2003, the <B>Acme100.PPD</B> <I>install-section-name</I> would resolve to the <B>[Acme100.PPD.NTia64]</B> <I>DDInstall</I> section.</P>
