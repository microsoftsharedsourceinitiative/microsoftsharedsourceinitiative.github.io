<P>Two render states of the D3DRENDERSTATETYPE enumeration control multi-sample rendering. For more information about D3DRENDERSTATETYPE, see the DirectX 8.0 SDK documentation.</P>

<H4>D3DRS_MULTISAMPLEANTIALIAS</H4>

<P>A BOOL value that determines how individual samples are computed when using a multi-sample render target buffer. When set to TRUE, the multiple samples are computed so that full-scene anti-aliasing is performed by sampling at different sample positions for each multiple sample. When set to FALSE, the multiple samples are all written with the same sample value (sampled at the pixel center), which allows non-antialiased rendering to a multi-sample buffer. This render state has no effect when rendering to a single sample buffer. The default value is TRUE.</P>

<H4>D3DRS_MULTISAMPLEMASK</H4>

<P>Each bit in this mask, starting at the LSB, controls modification of one of the samples in a multisample render target. Thus, for an 8-sample render target, the low byte contains the 8 write enables for each of the 8 samples. This render state has no effect when rendering to a single sample buffer. The default value is 0xFFFFFFFF. </P>

<P>This render state enables use of a multisample buffer as an accumulation buffer, doing multipass rendering of geometry where each pass updates a subset of samples. </P>

<P>Each sample in a multisample render target contributes uniform intensity to the final presented image. Consider, for example, that the multisample mode is 3 and the number of samples that are enabled using multisample masking is 2. Therefore, the resulting intensity of the rendered image is 2/3. That is, the intensity of each red, green, and blue component of every pixel is factored by 2/3. </P>
