<DD>Points to a RECTL structure that specifies the upper left and lower right points of a rectangle on the destination surface. These points define the area in which the blit should occur and its position on the destination surface.<BR>
<B>DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.</B><BR>
On NT-based operating systems, when DDBLT_EXTENDED_PRESENTATION_STRETCHFACTOR is set in the <B>dwFlags</B> member, the value in <B>rDest</B> must not be used as the unclipped destination rectangular area. Instead, use values in <B>bltFX</B> to specify coordinates of the original unclipped destination rectangle.</DD>

<DT><B>lpDDSrcSurface</B> </DT>

<DD>Points to a DD_SURFACE_LOCAL structure that describes the source surface.</DD>

<DT><B>rSrc</B></DT>

<DD>Points to a RECTL structure that specifies the upper left and lower right points of a rectangle on the source surface. These points define the area of the source blit data and its position on the source surface.<BR>
<B>DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.</B><BR>
On NT-based operating systems, when DDBLT_EXTENDED_PRESENTATION_STRETCHFACTOR is set in the <B>dwFlags</B> member, the value in <B>rSrc</B> is the original unclipped source rectangle. This is equivalent to the value in the <B>rOrigSrc</B> member for Windows 98/Me operating systems.</DD>

<DT><B>dwFlags</B> </DT>

<DD>Indicates a set of flags that specify the type of blit operation to perform and what associated structure members have valid data that the driver should use. This member is a bitwise OR of any of the following flags: 

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=48%>Flag</TH>
<TH align=left width=52%>Meaning</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_ASYNC</TD>
<TD width=52%>Perform this blit asynchronously through the FIFO in the order received. If no room exists in the hardware FIFO, the driver should fail the call and return immediately.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_COLORFILL</TD>
<TD width=52%>Use the <B>dwFillColor</B> member in the DDBLTFX structure (defined in the DirectDraw SDK documentation) as the RGB color with which to fill the destination rectangle on the destination surface.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_DDFX</TD>
<TD width=52%>Use the <B>dwDDFX</B> member in the DDBLTFX structure (defined in the DirectDraw SDK documentation) to determine the effects to use for the blit.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_DDROPS</TD>
<TD width=52%>This flag is reserved for system use and should be ignored by the driver. The driver should also ignore the <B>dwDDROPS</B> member of the DDBLTFX structure.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_EXTENDED_FLAGS</TD>
<TD width=52%><B>DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.<BR>
</B>Set by the runtime to direct the driver to reinterpret certain flags in <B>dwFlags</B> from their meanings in DirectX 8.1 and earlier versions. The runtime combines DDBLT_EXTENDED_FLAGS with DDBLT_<I>Xxx</I> flags using a bitwise OR to create DDBLT_EXTENDED_<I>Xxx</I> flags. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_EXTENDED_LINEAR_CONTENT</TD>
<TD width=52%><B>DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.<BR>
</B>Created through the bitwise OR combination of DDBLT_EXTENDED_FLAGS and the 0x00000004 bit. <BR>
Indicates that the source surface contains content in a linear color space. The driver can then perform gamma 2.2 correction (sRGB) to the desktop color space as part of the blt.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_EXTENDED_PRESENTATION_STRETCHFACTOR</TD>
<TD width=52%><B>DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.<BR>
NT-based operating systems only.</B><BR>
Created through the bitwise OR combination of DDBLT_EXTENDED_FLAGS and the 0x00000010 bit. <BR>
Set if the runtime subsequently uses the DDBLT_PRESENTATION and DDBLT_LAST_PRESENTATION flags to request a series of stretch-blit operations because of a <B>Present</B> call by an application.<BR>
Notifies the driver about the entire unclipped source and destination rectangular areas before the driver receives actual sub-rectangular areas for blits. In this way, the driver can calculate and record the stretch factor for all subsequent blits up to and including the blit with the DDBLT_LAST_PRESENTATION flag set. However, when the driver receives a blit with the DDBLT_EXTENDED_PRESENTATION_STRETCHFACTOR flag set, the driver must not use these unclipped rectangular areas to do any actual blitting. <BR>
After the driver finishes the final blit with the DDBLT_LAST_PRESENTATION flag set, the driver should clear the stretch-factor record to prevent interference with any subsequent blits.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_KEYDESTOVERRIDE</TD>
<TD width=52%>Use the <B>dckDestColorkey</B> member in the DDBLTFX structure (defined in the DirectDraw SDK documentation) as the color key for the destination surface. If an override is not being set, then <B>dckDestColorkey</B> does not contain the color key. The driver should test the surface itself.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_KEYSRCOVERRIDE</TD>
<TD width=52%>Use the <B>dckSrcColorkey</B> member in the DDBLTFX structure (defined in the DirectDraw SDK documentation) as the color key for the source surface. If an override is not being set, then <B>dckDestColorkey</B> does not contain the color key. The driver should test the surface itself.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_LAST_PRESENTATION</TD>
<TD width=52%><B>DirectX 8.0 and later versions only.</B><BR>
Set if the runtime requests a final blit operation because of a <B>Present</B> call by an application.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_PRESENTATION</TD>
<TD width=52%><B>DirectX 8.0 and later versions only.</B><BR>
Set if the runtime requests a blit operation because of a <B>Present</B> call by an application.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_ROP</TD>
<TD width=52%>Use the <B>dwROP</B> member in the DDBLTFX structure (defined in the DirectDraw SDK documentation) for the raster operation for this blit. Currently, the only <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">ROP</A> passed to the driver is SRCCOPY. This ROP is the same as that defined in the Win32® API. See the Platform SDK documentation for details.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_ROTATIONANGLE</TD>
<TD width=52%>This flag is not supported on Windows&nbsp;2000 and later and should be ignored by the driver.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDBLT_WAIT</TD>
<TD width=52%>Do not return immediately with the DDERR_WASSTILLDRAWING message if the blitter is busy—wait until the blit can be set up or another error occurs.</TD>

</TABLE><BR>

</DD>

<DT><B>dwROPFlags</B> </DT>

<DD>Unused on Windows&nbsp;2000 and later and should be ignored by the driver.</DD>

<DT><B>bltFX</B> </DT>

<DD>Specifies a DDBLTFX structure (defined in the DirectDraw SDK documentation) that contains override information for more complex blit operations. For example, the <B>dwFillColor</B> member is used for solid color fills, and the <B>ddckSrcColorKey</B> and <B>ddckDestColorKey</B> members are used for color key blits. The driver can determine which members of <B>bltFX</B> contain valid data by looking at the <B>dwFlags</B> member of the DD_BLTDATA structure. Note that the DDBLTFX_NOTEARING, DDBLTFX_MIRRORLEFTRIGHT, and DDBLTFX_MIRRORUPDOWN flags are unsupported on Windows 2000 and later and are never passed to the driver. For information about the DDBLTFX structure, see the Platform SDK documentation.<BR>
<B>DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.</B><BR>
On NT-based operating systems, when DDBLT_EXTENDED_PRESENTATION_STRETCHFACTOR is set in the <B>dwFlags</B> member, values in <B>bltFX</B> specify coordinates of the original unclipped destination rectangle. For more information on how these coordinates are specified, see <A HREF="d3d_00iv.htm">Supporting Stretch Blit Operations</A>. These coordinates are equivalent to those in the <B>rOrigDest</B> member for Windows 98/Me operating systems.</DD>

<DT><B>ddRVal</B> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the location in which the driver writes the return value of the <I>DdBlt</I> callback. A return code of DD_OK indicates success.</DD>

<DT><B>Blt</B> </DT>

<DD>Used by the DirectDraw API and should not be filled in by the driver.</DD>

<DT><B>IsClipped</B> </DT>

<DD>Indicates whether this is a clipped blit. On Windows&nbsp;2000 and later, this member is always FALSE, indicating that the blit is unclipped.</DD>

<DT><B>rOrigDest</B> </DT>

<DD><B>Unused for Windows 2000 and later.</B> Specifies a RECTL structure that defines the unclipped destination rectangle. This member is valid only if <B>IsClipped</B> is TRUE. </DD>

<DT><B>rOrigSrc</B> </DT>

<DD><B>Unused for Windows 2000 and later.</B> Specifies a RECTL structure that defines the unclipped source rectangle. This member is valid only if <B>IsClipped</B> is TRUE.</DD>

<DT><B>dwRectCnt</B> </DT>

<DD><B>Unused for Windows 2000 and later.</B> Specifies the number of destination rectangles to which <B>prDestRects</B> points. This member is valid only if <B>IsClipped</B> is TRUE.</DD>

<DT><B>prDestRects</B> </DT>

<DD><B>Unused for Windows 2000 and later.</B> Points to an array of RECTL structures that describe of destination rectangles. This member is valid only if <B>IsClipped</B> is TRUE.</DD>

<DT><B>dwAFlags</B></DT>

<DD>Unused and should be ignored by the driver.</DD>
