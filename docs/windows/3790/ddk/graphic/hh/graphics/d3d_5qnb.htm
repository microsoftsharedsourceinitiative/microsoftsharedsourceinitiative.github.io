<P>Although not the recommended mechanism for supporting multi-sampling, the driver can implement multi-sampling support by rendering to a large back buffer and performing a stretch blt to resample the large back buffer to the lower resolution primary. However, if this is the mechanism by which the driver supports multi-sampling, the driver must set the new capability bit D3DPRASTERCAPS_STRETCHBLTMULTISAMPLE in the <B>RasterCaps</B> member of the D3D8CAPS structure. For a description of D3DCAPS8, see the DirectX 8.0 SDK documentation. </P>

<P>When the driver sets the D3DPRASTERCAPS_STRETCHBLTMULTISAMPLE bit, it indicates that it: 

<UL>
	<LI>Fails requests from applications to enable and disable full-scene anti-aliasing while the same scene is being rendered. That is, it fails requests to turn on and off the <B>BOOL</B> value of the D3DRS_MULTISAMPLEANTIALIAS device render state (D3DRENDERSTATETYPE) during the rendering of a single scene. Note that requests to change the <B>BOOL</B> value of D3DRS_MULTISAMPLEANTIALIAS must not fail for a different scene. That is, if D3DRS_MULTISAMPLEANTIALIAS is TRUE for one scene, it could be FALSE for another scene.</LI>

	<LI>Is nonresponsive to requests from applications to modify samples in a multisample render target. That is, it does not respond to setting the bitmask of the D3DRS_MULTISAMPLEMASK device render state (D3DRENDERSTATETYPE).</LI>
</UL>

<P>It is important to note that if the driver uses a stretch blt to perform a page flip in fullscreen mode, the driver should specify the supported sample counts in the <B>wFlipMSTypes</B> member of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_6wtj.htm">DDPIXELFORMAT</A>'s <B>MultiSampleCaps</B> structure and not the <B>wBltMSTypes</B> member as a flip is being performed.</P>
