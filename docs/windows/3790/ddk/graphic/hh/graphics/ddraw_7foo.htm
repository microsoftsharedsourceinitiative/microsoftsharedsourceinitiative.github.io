<P><B>This topic applies only to Windows Me.</B></P>

<P>To allow easier software support for downloadable gamma ramps on the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;98/Me and Windows&nbsp;2000 and later operating systems, a gamma interface called <B>IDirectDrawGammaControl</B> has been added to Microsoft DirectDraw®. Available in Microsoft DirectX® 6.0 and later versions, this interface enables game developers to manipulate gamma ramp levels and to tell the system what the perceived gamma on the primary surface in full screen exclusive mode should be. As a result, applications can quickly change the red, green, and blue color components of pixels before they are sent to the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for display.</P>

<P>You can use either the Microsoft Win32® application programming interface (API) or the <B>IDirectDrawGammaControl</B> interface. There are three significant differences between <A HREF="ddfncs_3s4n.htm"><B>SetDeviceGammaRamp</B></A> and the DirectDraw API: 

<UL>
	<LI><B>SetDeviceGammaRamp</B> does not allow all gamma ramps. It checks the gamma ramp; if it is too complex, such as the red flash when the player is shot in Quake, it rejects the gamma ramp. </LI>

	<LI><B>SetDeviceGammaRamp</B> will not currently make use of a gamma calibrator. This may change in future versions of Image Color Management (ICM), but for Windows 2000 only the DirectDraw API supports the gamma calibrators. </LI>

	<LI>The gamma ramp set by DirectDraw is guaranteed to clean up correctly when the application is closed. If an application calls <B>SetDeviceGammaRamp</B> and does not restore the old gamma ramp, it is not automatically cleaned up.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The existing gamma entry points are already used by <A HREF="ddfncs_627b.htm"><B>GetDeviceGammaRamp</B></A> and <B>SetDeviceGammaRamp</B>. Therefore, the display driver doesn't need to do anything special to support this new interface, as long as it already supports the Win32 <B>Get/SetDeviceGammaRamp</B> functions.</P>

<P>In addition to getting and setting gamma ramps, the new DirectDraw interface allows the new gamma ramp to be calibrated, provided that a gamma calibrator is installed. The mechanism that DirectDraw uses to register and communicate with the gamma calibrator is an interim mechanism that will be changed in future releases.</P>

<P>DirectDraw looks for an installed software calibrator and passes the gamma value to the software calibrator; the software calibrator in turn adjusts the gamma ramp according to the measured response of the monitor. The calibrator passes the gamma ramp back to DirectDraw, which passes it to the <B>SetDeviceGammaRamp</B> device driver interface (DDI). The result is that the game looks as intended.</P>

<P>For DirectDraw to use the gamma calibrator, the calibrator must register itself with DirectDraw using a registry key; DirectDraw calls it if the application wants the gamma ramp to be calibrated.</P>

<P>In the future, both the method by which DirectDraw communicates with the gamma calibrator, through the DDI, and the method gamma calibrators use to register themselves in the registry will change. But every part of the DirectDraw API is permanent.</P>

<P>ICM is the color management system in Windows; all system level color management should be handled by ICM. For this reason, downloadable gamma ramp support will be rolled into ICM in the future, making current solutions for gamma calibrators obsolete. Until such time, we have provided a method by which applications can take advantage of the installed base of software calibrators and graphics adapters that support downloadable gamma ramps.</P>
