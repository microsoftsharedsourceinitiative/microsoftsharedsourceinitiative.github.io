<P>This section contains the DirectDraw driver structure whose name has the form DDCORECAPS, which is the form used on Windows&nbsp;98/Me. This structure is identical to that whose name has the form DDNTCORECAPS which is the form used on Windows&nbsp;2000 and later versions. The include file <I>dx95type.h</I> contains a type define from DDNTCORECAPS to DDCORECAPS.</P>

<P>This structure mirrors the first entries of the DDCAPS structure, but is of a fixed size and does not grow as DDCAPS does.</P>

<P>The driver initializes DDCORECAPS when it is initializing the other members of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_17s7.htm">DD_HALINFO</A> structure in its <A HREF="ddfncs_4yav.htm"><I>DrvGetDirectDrawInfo</I></A> structure. The DirectDraw runtime might update some members.</P>

<P>DirectDraw requests additional driver capabilities by calling the <A HREF="ddfncs_0yhz.htm"><I>DdGetDriverInfo</I></A> function that is also returned in the DD_HALINFO structure.</P>
