<P>OEMs and IHVs who write 16-bit GDI display drivers can provide a more accurate and positive end-user experience by incorporating support for downloadable gamma ramps. Reasons to support downloadable gamma ramps include: 

<UL>
	<LI><B>User enjoyment</B>  ISVs who create games want the user to have a consistent visual experience regardless of the system being used. Without color management and downloadable gamma ramps, the user is forced to tweak brightness settings, contrast settings, or color adjustments, while hoping to find settings that provide an appealing color environment. Top-tier game ISVs have asked for programmable gamma ramps so their games can appear as intended, including flare effects in games such as the red flash that occurs when the player gets hit in Quake. </LI>

	<LI><B>Accurate online color representation</B>  With the strong growth of e-commerce, companies making products available through online catalogs will require color management capabilities so that online customers can see a product's true colors. </LI>

	<LI><B>Color consistency across devices</B>  Users want the output of their color images to look very similar to the image on the monitor. Graphics boards with downloadable gamma ramps are a much-needed component of a good color management system.</LI>
</UL>

<P>To improve the customer's color experience on the PC, downloadable gamma ramp support is a requirement for the Microsoft® Windows® Logo Program for hardware. (See the guidelines in PC 98:14.11, "Adapter supports downloadable RAMDAC entries for image color matching.") Both graphics board drivers and the graphics adapters are required to support downloadable gamma ramps, so the original level of red, green, and blue color components for all pixels in a frame buffer can be replaced with calibrated values.</P>

<P>As systems evolve and need to use both 2D and 3D graphics for applications, they will require multiple gamma ramps to provide an enjoyable and repeatable experience. Traditional 3D has a gamma of 1.0, while most images have a range of gammas from 1.8, for Macintosh and Adobe PhotoShop, to 2.2, for standard red, green, blue (sRGB). When these are mixed on the multimedia desktop, at least two gammas are needed. Microsoft encourages vendors to support multiple programmable gamma ramps.</P>
