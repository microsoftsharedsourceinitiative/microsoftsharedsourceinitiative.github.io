<P>A DirectX 9.0 version driver for a device that supports adaptive tessellation and displacement mapping for high-order patched surfaces must indicate such support with capability bits and be able to process new adaptive-tessellation render states and a displacement-map texture stage state. For more information on adaptive tessellation and displacement mapping, see the latest DirectX SDK.</P>

<P>To indicate support of adaptive tessellation and displacement mapping, the driver sets the following capability bits in the <B>DevCaps2</B> member of the D3DCAPS9 structure: 

<DL>
<DT>D3DDEVCAPS2_ADAPTIVETESSRTPATCH</DT>

<DD>Device can adaptively tessellate render-target patches.</DD>

<DT>D3DDEVCAPS2_ADAPTIVETESSNPATCH</DT>

<DD>Device can adaptively tessellate N-patches.</DD>

<DT>D3DDEVCAPS2_DMAPNPATCH</DT>

<DD>Device supports displacement maps for N-patches.</DD>

<DT>D3DDEVCAPS2_PRESAMPLEDDMAPNPATCH</DT>

<DD>Device supports presampled displacement maps for N-patches.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>To indicate the maximum number of N-patch subdivisions that the display device can support, the driver sets the <B>MaxNpatchTessellationLevel</B> member of the D3DCAPS9 structure to the maximum number. Applications that use presampled displacement mapping are affected by the device clamping to this maximum number.</P>

<P>The driver returns a D3DCAPS9 structure in response to a <B>GetDriverInfo2</B> query similarly to how it returns a D3DCAPS8 structure as described in <A HREF="d3d_0r6v.htm">Reporting DirectX 8.0 Style Direct3D Capabilities</A>. Support of this query is described in <A HREF="d3d_052f.htm">Supporting <B>GetDriverInfo2</B></A>. </P>

<P>The driver specifies the D3DFORMAT_OP_DMAP flag in the <B>dwOperations</B> member of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_6wtj.htm">DDPIXELFORMAT</A> structure for a particular surface format to mark the format for displacement-map sampling. When a texture surface is created, the Direct3D runtime sets the DDSCAPS3_DMAP bit of the <B>dwCaps3</B> member of the DDSCAPSEX (<A HREF="ddstrcts_3jqf.htm">DDSCAPS2</A>) structure to indicate that the texture can be sampled in the tessellation unit.</P>

<P>Note that DirectX 9.0 and later drivers must turn off the N-patch feature only when the value of the D3DRS_PATCHSEGMENTS render state is less than 1.0f. DirectX 8.1 and earlier drivers are not required to behave in this manner. </P>

<P>The following adaptive-tessellation render states along with their default values are new for DirectX 9.0:</P>

<P class=indent1>D3DRS_MAXTESSELLATIONLEVEL = 1.0f </P>

<P class=indent1>D3DRS_MINTESSELLATIONLEVEL = 1.0f </P>

<P class=indent1>D3DRS_ADAPTIVETESS_X = 0.0f </P>

<P class=indent1>D3DRS_ADAPTIVETESS_Y = 0.0f </P>

<P class=indent1>D3DRS_ADAPTIVETESS_Z = 1.0f </P>

<P class=indent1>D3DRS_ADAPTIVETESS_W = 0.0f </P>

<P class=indent1>D3DRS_ENABLEADAPTIVETESSELLATION = FALSE </P>

<P>The D3DDMAPSAMPLER sampler, which is also new for DirectX 9.0, is used in the tessellation unit to set a displacement map texture.</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;DirectX 9.0 and later applications can use the D3DSAMP_DMAPOFFSET value in the D3DSAMPLERSTATETYPE enumeration to control the offset, in vertices, into the presampled displacement map. The runtime maps user-mode sampler states (D3DSAMP_<I>Xxx</I>) to kernel-mode D3DTSS_<I>Xxx</I> values so that DirectX 9.0 and later drivers are not required to process user-mode sampler states. Therefore, drivers must instead process the D3DTSS_DMAPOFFSET value in the <B>TSState</B> member of the <A HREF="d3dstrct_2ihz.htm">D3DHAL_DP2TEXTURESTAGESTATE</A> structure for <A HREF="d3denum_0jon.htm#ddk_d3ddp2op_texturestagestate_gg">D3DDP2OP_TEXTURESTAGESTATE</A> operations. For more information on D3DSAMPLERSTATETYPE and presampled displacement mapping, see the latest DirectX SDK documentation.</P>
