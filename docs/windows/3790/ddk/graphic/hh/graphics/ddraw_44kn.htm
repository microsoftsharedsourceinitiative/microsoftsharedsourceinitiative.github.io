<P>Whenever DirectDraw requests the driver to create a surface, the driver must determine whether it is being asked to create a compressed texture surface. To determine this, the driver must check for information that has previously been set by DirectDraw in the <A HREF="ddstrcts_59k7.htm">DDSURFACEDESC2</A> structure for the surface being created. Your driver must include the following verification steps (as with any surface): 

<UL>
	<LI>Check for the DDSCAPS_TEXTURE flag in the <B>dwFlags</B> member of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_6zhj.htm">DDSCAPS</A> structure.</LI>

	<LI>Check for the DDPF_FOURCC flag in the <B>dwFlags</B> member of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_6wtj.htm">DDPIXELFORMAT</A> structure for the surface being created. This check should occur before the following <B>dwFourCC</B> check.</LI>

	<LI>Check for one of the DXT codes in the <B>dwFourCC</B> member of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_6wtj.htm">DDPIXELFORMAT</A> structure for the surface being created.</LI>

	<LI>Check the width and height members (<B>dwWidth</B> and <B>dwHeight</B>) of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_59k7.htm">DDSURFACEDESC2</A> structure. DirectDraw sets these members to multiples of 4 pixels.</LI>
