<P>The Direct3D 8.0 runtime fully supports the clipping of pretransformed vertices through both the <B>DrawPrimitive</B> and <B>ProcessVertices</B> API calls. This clipping includes user defined clipping planes as well as Z and the X and Y viewport extents. However, the runtime does not guarantee the clipping of post-transformed vertices. Post-transformed vertex data is passed directly from the application to the driver by the runtime. This does not imply that a driver is required to fully clip post-transformed vertex data. A new capability flag D3DPMISCCAPS_CLIPTLVERTS has been added for DirectX 8.0. If the driver sets this flag in the <B>PrimitiveMiscCaps</B>  field of the D3DCAPS8 structure, the application can assume that the driver fully clips post-transformed vertex data to Z and the X and Y viewport extents. Clipping to user-defined clip planes is never supported for post-transformed data. If the driver does not set this flag, the application is required to performing clipping of the post-transformed data to the Z extents and to (at least) the guard band extents in X and Y.</P>

<P>It is important to note that the runtime does not validate that the application has correctly clipped post-transformed data. It is the driver’s responsibility to ensure that a crash or hang does not occur if unclipped or incorrectly clipped data is passed when this flag is set.</P>
