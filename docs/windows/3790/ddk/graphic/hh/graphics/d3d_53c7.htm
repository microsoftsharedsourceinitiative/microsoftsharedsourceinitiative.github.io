<P>A DirectX 9.0 version driver can support single-pixel-wide lines that are either alias or antialias. The driver indicates antialias support by setting the D3DLINECAPS_ANTIALIAS capability bit in the <B>LineCaps</B> member of the D3DCAPS9 structure. The driver returns a D3DCAPS9 structure in response to a <B>GetDriverInfo2</B> query similarly to how it returns a D3DCAPS8 structure as described in <A HREF="d3d_0r6v.htm">Reporting DirectX 8.0 Style Direct3D Capabilities</A>. Support of this query is described in <A HREF="d3d_052f.htm">Supporting <B>GetDriverInfo2</B></A>. </P>

<P>To enable line antialiasing, the driver receives the <A HREF="d3denum_0jon.htm#ddk_d3ddp2op_renderstate_gg">D3DDP2OP_RENDERSTATE</A> operation code in the <A HREF="d3d_7fs7.htm">command stream</A> of its <A HREF="d3dfncs_5usn.htm"><I>D3dDrawPrimitives2</I></A> function. The driver processes the D3DRS_ANTIALIASEDLINEENABLE render state from the <B>RenderState</B> member of the <A HREF="d3dstrct_8pif.htm">D3DHAL_DP2RENDERSTATE</A> structure that is associated with this operation code. The driver determines whether to enable or disable line antialiasing from the Boolean value in the <B>dwState</B> member of D3DHAL_DP2RENDERSTATE. The value TRUE means to enable and FALSE means to disable. By default, this render-state value is set to FALSE.</P>

<P>The D3DRS_ANTIALIASEDLINEENABLE render state applies to triangles drawn in wire-frame mode as well as line-drawing primitive types. </P>

<P>When rendering to a multiple-sample render target, the driver must ignore a request to enable line antialiasing and render all lines aliased.</P>
