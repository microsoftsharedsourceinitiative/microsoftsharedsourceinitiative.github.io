<P>In the DirectDraw DDI, the creation of a primary flipping chain has no intrinsic pixel format. Consequently, surfaces in this chain take on the pixel format of the display mode. For example, a primary flipping chain created in a 32bpp mode takes on a D3DFMT_X8R8G8B8 format. </P>

<P>Such a chain is created for many full-screen applications. Because the back buffer of the chain has no alpha channel, the D3DRS_ALPHABLENDENABLE render state and the associated blend-render states for destination surfaces are poorly defined. DirectX 8.1 introduces a new feature that the Direct3D runtime uses to inform a driver of an application's request to create a full-screen flipping chain of surfaces with an alpha channel in the pixel formats of those surfaces.</P>

<P>To indicate support of this feature, the driver must set the D3DCAPS3_ALPHA_FULLSCREEN_FLIP_OR_DISCARD bit (defined in the <I>d3d8caps.h</I> file) in the <B>Caps3</B> member of the D3DCAPS8 structure. The driver returns a D3DCAPS8 structure in response to a <B>GetDriverInfo2</B> query as described in <A HREF="d3d_0r6v.htm">Reporting DirectX 8.0 Style Direct3D Capabilities</A>. Support of this query is described in <A HREF="d3d_052f.htm">Supporting GetDriverInfo2</A>.</P>

<P>After support of this feature is determined, the driver can receive <A HREF="ddfncs_6bdz.htm"><I>DdCreateSurface</I></A> calls with the DDSCAPS2_ENABLEALPHACHANNEL (defined in the <I>ddraw.h</I> file) bit set in the <B>dwCaps2</B> member of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_3jqf.htm">DDSCAPS2</A> structure. This bit is only set to create surfaces that are part of a primary flipping chain or that are on stand-alone back buffers. </P>

<P>If the driver detects this bit, the driver determines that the surfaces take on not the display mode's format, but the display mode's format plus alpha. For example, in a 32bpp mode, such surfaces should be given the D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8 format. </P>

<P>This feature is available on Windows XP and later versions and  on Windows 2000 and Windows 98/Me operating system versions that have the DirectX 8.1 runtime installed.</P>
