<DT><B>ulDevicePelsDPI</B></DT>

<DD>For printers, specifies the number of pixels (or dots, or nozzles) per inch if the pixels are laid out side by side without overlapping or space between. For example, if the size of a pixel is 0.001 inch, this value is equal to one-divided-by 0.001. If the member is zero, GDI halftoning calculates this number based on the assumption that all pixels are connected with no overlapping. 

<P>Because the physical dot size for most printers is larger than the measured dot size, GDI uses this value to approximate how many physical dots can be placed, based on the cell size (pattern size). A log regression is then performed to determine what is most linear; that is, where the dots should be placed for the best coverage to optimize the overlapped device pixels coverage (dot gain).


<P>For displays, this member should be set to zero.

The color fragments can be configured in horizontal stripes in which all of the fragments in one row are the same color. Alternatively, the color fragments can be configured in vertical stripes, in which all fragments in one column are the same color.

These style steps are defined by the driver to ensure that the dots and dashes in a line are a pleasing size on the output device. The horizontal and vertical steps can be different to correct for non trivial aspect ratios. For example, on an EGA display, whose pixels are 33 percent higher than they are wide, you can set:</P>

<PRE>pdevcaps-&gt;xStyleStep   =  3;    // For an EGA
pdevcaps-&gt;yStyleStep   =  4;
pdevcaps-&gt;denStyleStep = 12;</PRE>

<P>In this case, horizontal dotted lines are 4-pixels-on, 4-pixels-off, because the style advances by 3/12 or 1/4 for each pixel. Vertical dotted lines are 3-pixels-on/3-pixels-off.</P>

<P>Styled lines look better if both the x and y style steps divide evenly into the style denominator, as they do in the preceding example. This gives dashes and dots that are always the same length.</P>

<P>GDI needs this information so that its bitmap functions can emulate exactly what the device does on its own surface. Applications can access this information to determine exactly which pixels will be turned on for styled lines. Refer also to <A HREF="ddioview_604n.htm">Styled Cosmetic Lines</A>.</P>

<P>The halftone-related members, <B>cxHTPat</B>, <B>cyHTPat</B>, <B>pHTPatA</B>, <B>pHTPatB</B>, and <B>pHTPatC</B>, can be used in an OEM Unidrv rendering plug-in to define a custom halftone pattern consisting of either one or three colors. These members are checked only if the <B>ulHTPatternSize</B> member is set to HT_PATSIZE_USER. In this case an OEM can use these members to define a custom halftone pattern, based on data stored in a resource file or generated by an OEM customization module. The <B>cxHTPat</B> and <B>cyHTPat</B> members define the size of each of the three two-dimensional halftone pattern arrays. The <B>pHTPatA</B>, <B>pHTPatB</B>, and <B>pHTPatC</B> members point to the respective pattern arrays for each color. If only one pattern array is used, <B>pHTPatA</B> points to it, and the other two pointers are set to NULL.</P>

<P>Each byte threshold at a particular location in a halftone dither pattern determines whether the pixel at the corresponding output plane location will be on or off. A zero threshold value at a particular location in the pattern array indicates that the corresponding pixel location is ignored (is black). Threshold values from 1 to 255 provide the dither pattern with 255 levels of gray; if the pixel value in the output plane is greater than or equal to the threshold value for that location, the pixel is turned on. A pixel value less than its corresponding threshold value causes its pixel to be turned off in the output plane.
