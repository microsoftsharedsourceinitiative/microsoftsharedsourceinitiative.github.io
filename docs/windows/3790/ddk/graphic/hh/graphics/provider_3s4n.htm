<P>After a port has been added, as described in <A HREF="provider_6aef.htm">Adding a Port</A>, the spooler can open it by calling the appropriate language monitor’s <A HREF="spoolfnc_12nb.htm"><B>OpenPortEx</B></A> function.</P>

<P>The language monitor uses the <B>OpenPortEx</B> function to create and return a port handle. Typically, a language monitor calls its associated port monitor’s <A HREF="spoolfnc_11yf.htm"><B>OpenPort</B></A> function, and the language monitor just returns the handle obtained from the port monitor’s <B>OpenPort</B>.</P>

<P>If a language monitor is not associated with a port, the spooler calls the port monitor’s <B>OpenPort</B> function directly.</P>

<P>The spooler does not allow more than one path to a port to be enabled at one time. Thus, after it has called <B>OpenPortEx</B> (or <B>OpenPort</B>) in a particular monitor, it does not attempt to open the same port again before closing it.</P>

<P>After a port has been opened, the spooler can call additional functions to print a job, as described in <A HREF="provider_9o6f.htm">Printing a Print Job</A>, using the port handle as an input argument. A monitor should be written so that, after a port has been opened, the spooler can send multiple print jobs before closing the port.</P>

<P>The spooler closes a port if a job must be sent through a different language monitor, if no print queues are associated with a port, or when the system shuts down. To close a port, the spooler calls a language monitor’s <A HREF="spoolfnc_9xk7.htm"><B>ClosePort</B></A> function. The function invalidates the handle that was created when the port was opened. A language monitor typically calls the <B>ClosePort</B> function defined by its associated port monitor.</P>

<P>If a language monitor is not associated with a port, the spooler calls the port monitor’s <B>ClosePort</B> function directly.</P>
