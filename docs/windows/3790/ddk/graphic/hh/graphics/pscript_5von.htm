<P>PPD features are defined in the PPD file within <B>*OpenUI</B>/<B>*CloseUI</B> structure keyword pairs, and in certain PPD keywords that are treated similarly by the Pscript driver. Although <B>EnumFeatures</B> lists the <B>*LeadingEdge</B> and <B>*UseHWMargins</B> keywords, they are not defined within PPD <B>*OpenUI</B>/<B>*CloseUI</B> structure keyword pairs. Consequently, the <B>GetOptions</B> and <B>SetOptions</B> methods ignore these keywords if they appear in the feature list. The PPD feature/option keywords are case sensitive.</P>

<P><B>SetOptions</B> handles certain PPD features in a special way:

<UL>
	<LI>If the printer’s PPD file includes the <B>*OutputOrder</B> feature keyword and <B>SetOptions</B> is called to change the option selection for this feature, then the <B>%PageOrder </B>driver feature setting will be changed to match the new output order. This is done in order to prevent the spooler from performing unnecessary page order simulation.</LI>

	<LI>If the printer’s PPD file includes the <B>*OutputBin</B> feature keyword and <B>SetOptions</B> is called to change the option selection for this feature, and the change causes the current setting of the <B>%PageOrder</B> driver feature to be the opposite of the printer's page ordering, and <B>%MetafileSpooling</B> is "False", then <B>%MetafileSpooling</B> will be reset to "True".</LI>

	<LI>When spooler EMF spooling is enabled, and <B>Collate</B> is set to "True" (this can be set either directly in the public portion of the <A HREF="grstrcts_6v8n.htm">DEVMODE</A> structure or by calling <B>SetOptions</B> on the PPD's <B>*Collate</B> feature keyword), but the <B>Collate</B> feature is not currently available, and <B>%MetafileSpooling</B> is "False", then <B>%MetafileSpooling</B> will be reset to "True". This is done when all requested settings in the <B>SetOptions</B> call are applied.</LI>

	<LI>If <B>Duplex</B> is set to simplex (this can be set either directly in the public portion of the DEVMODE structure or by calling <B>SetOptions</B> on the PPD's <B>*Duplex</B> feature keyword), but <B>%PagePerSheet</B> is set to “Booklet”, then <B>%PagePerSheet</B> will be changed to “2”. This is done when all requested settings in the <B>SetOptions</B> call are applied.</LI>
