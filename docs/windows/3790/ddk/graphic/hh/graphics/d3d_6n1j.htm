<P>The DirectDraw runtime calls the driver’s <A HREF="d3dfncs_0gtj.htm"><I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I></A> entry point after it has called the <A HREF="ddfncs_6bdz.htm"><I>DdCreateSurface</I></A> entry point and allocated memory for the surface. The runtime calls <I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I> only for those surfaces tagged with DDSCAPS_TEXTURE, DDSCAPS_EXECUTEBUFFER, DDSCAPS_3DDEVICE, or DDSCAPS_ZBUFFER flags.</P>

<P>Before calling <A HREF="d3dfncs_0gtj.htm"><I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I></A>, the runtime assigns an integer value as a handle to the surface. This value is stored in the <B>dwSurfaceHandle</B> member of the DDRAWI_DDSURFACE_MORE structure (as pointed to by the <B>lpSurfMore</B> member of the DDRAWI_DDSURFACE_LCL structure). See <A HREF="ddstrcts_3esn.htm">DD_SURFACE_MORE</A> and <A HREF="ddstrcts_1vl4.htm">DD_SURFACE_LOCAL</A>, which are aliases for the DDRAWI_DDSURFACE_MORE and DDRAWI_DDSURFACE_LCL structures.</P>

<P>These integer values start at one and are kept as small as possible. (Zero is a guaranteed invalid value for a surface handle.) The intention is that a driver can keep an array of pointers into its own structures. As soon as it receives a handle (when <I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I> is called) that is beyond the end of the array, it can reallocate the array and continue. The Direct3D runtime passes no handle value to the driver before that handle is shown to the driver via <I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I>. However, the driver should be robust enough to handle values that are out-of-range, or that refer to a slot in the handle table that has been freed (that is a handle for which <A HREF="ddfncs_1c4n.htm"><I>DdDestroySurface</I></A> has been called). Note that since zero is a guaranteed invalid value, the zero entry in the handle table can be reused for other purposes. The <I>perm3</I> sample driver uses the zero entry to store the current length of the array. </P>
