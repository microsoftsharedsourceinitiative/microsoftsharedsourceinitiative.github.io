<P>A good way to begin implementing DirectDraw functionality is to modify an existing driver. If no driver is available, start with the sample code in the DirectDraw portion of the DDK and get driver initialization, lock, and flip working. From that base functionality, more powerful functionality can be added that will improve display performance. </P>

<P>The DirectX Software Development Kit (SDK), which can be found in the Platform SDK, includes useful <I>help</I> and <I>readme</I> files, sample code, and tools such as DirectDraw Test (<I>ddtest.exe</I> on the DirectX 7.0 SDK) that allows monitoring and testing of driver capabilities during the development process. A remote terminal in conjunction with the kernel debugger and debug <B>printf</B> statements are indispensable tools for verifying each action the driver takes. </P>

<P>The minimum driver functionality DirectDraw requires is the ability to lock, unlock, and flip a surface. Assuming the hardware supports the related operations, driver support should also be added for blts (including transparent blts, which are important for speed in games), stretching, and overlays, which are critical for video playback. </P>
