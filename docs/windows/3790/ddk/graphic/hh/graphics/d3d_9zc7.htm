<P>In DirectX 8.0, vertex (and index) buffers can be managed as textures were in DirectX 7.0. That is, a system memory copy of a vertex buffer is maintained at all times and a video memory copy is only allocated when that vertex buffer is actually required. </P>

<P>If the driver does not allocate a vertex buffer in video memory but, instead, requires the runtime to allocate the buffer in system memory, it should not return DDHAL_DRIVER_NOTHANDLED but rather should return DDHAL_DRIVER_HANDLED and indicate failure by setting a <B>ddRVal</B> of E_FAIL. If the driver returns DDHAL_DRIVER_NOTHANDLED, the runtime attempts to allocate the surface from the video memory heaps returned by the driver. This may either fail and return an error to the application or result in the surface being allocated in local or nonlocal video memory (which is not the intention).</P>

<P>Therefore, if you wish the runtime to allocate a vertex buffer in system memory on your behalf, set <B>ddRVal</B> to E_FAIL and return DDHAL_DRIVER_HANDLED.</P>
