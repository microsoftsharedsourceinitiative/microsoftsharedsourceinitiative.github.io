<H4>Creating Installation Files for Driver-Only Installation </H4>

<P>In this scenario, the hardware vendor provides  all the driver files that make up the device driver in the distribution package, including the device's INF file. </P>

<P>DirectX does not provide a method for hardware vendors to distribute the runtime components. For information about distributing these components, send e-mail to <I>directx@microsoft.com</I>.</P>

<H4>Using DirectX Setup</H4>

<P>During the end-user installation process, DirectX Setup is executed to install the DirectX subsystem. DirectX Setup installs the entire DirectX subsystem, consisting of Microsoft DirectDraw®, DirectSound®, DirectPlay®, Direct3D®, and DirectInput®; there is no option for partial installation. When redistributed by ISVs and on the Web, DirectX Setup also upgrades drivers if necessary.</P>

<P>DirectX Setup for DirectX uses version numbering and detection of registered drivers to decide whether a driver will be updated. To determine a driver's version number, DirectX Setup examines the version numbers of all files composing the device driver and uses the highest as the version number for the entire driver. </P>

<P>In DirectX, the Setup application backs up any driver that is replaced during installation, and also installs <I>dxsetup.exe</I> as a part of the DirectX subsystem. In addition, the capability for uninstalling DirectX drivers is registered with <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> in <B>Control Panel</B>. </P>
