<P>To a storage port driver, a storage class driver is a higher-level driver with built-in, device-type-specific functionality. In general, every storage class driver is responsible for the following: 

<UL>
	<LI>Claiming each device represented by a physical device object (PDO) passed to its <I>AddDevice</I> routine by the PnP Manager</LI>

	<LI>For each such PDO, creating a functional device object (FDO) and attaching it to the device stack</LI>

	<LI>If the driver controls a partitionable device, creating physical device objects (PDOs) to represent each partition and responding to enumeration requests</LI>

	<LI>Interpreting system I/O requests (IRPs) </LI>

	<LI>Mapping IRPs to SCSI class/port interface requests (SRBs with SCSI CDBs) </LI>

	<LI>Establishing time-out values for requests </LI>

	<LI>Limiting the size of data transfers to suit the limits of the underlying HBA </LI>

	<LI>Handling error conditions that are not already handled by the storage port driver, such as check-condition status or bus resets </LI>
</UL>
