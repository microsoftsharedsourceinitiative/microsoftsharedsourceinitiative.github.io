<P>All storage class drivers are required to set the minor function code with IRP_MN_SCSI_CLASS in the port driver's I/O stack location of any IRP that a class driver allocates and sets up to send on to the system port driver. For example, a legacy  class driver must set this minor function code when it makes an IOCTL_SCSI_GET_ADDRESS request to obtain the address of a target device.</P>

<P>For incoming IRPs originating with a user I/O request or with a higher-level driver, storage class drivers should ignore the minor function code in the port driver's I/O stack location, leaving it as is. In general, such requests can be sent directly to the system-supplied port driver <I>only if no storage class driver for the target device exists</I>. Otherwise, such requests must be directed to the storage class driver for the appropriate type of underlying storage device.</P>

<P>The following shows I/O control requests that a storage port driver supports. All public I/O control codes for the port driver use buffered I/O. Consequently, most input or output data for these requests is at <B>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</B>.</P>
