<P>A higher-level SFD intercepts IRPs from user applications and higher-level drivers and modifies them as needed before passing them to the next-lower driver (a storage class driver or another filter driver). Such an SFD supplies device-specific support for requests that require special handling, such as translating data sent to or returned from the device in a nonstandard format, or programming the device in response to an IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL request. </P>

<P>A lower-level SFD monitors SRBs and/or IRPs issued by a storage class driver and modifies them as needed before passing them to the next-lower driver (a storage port driver or another filter driver). </P>

<P>Both higher- and lower-level SFDs can let the lower drivers process all I/O requests that require no special handling.</P>

<P>Like a storage class driver, an SFD has the following requirements common to all higher-level kernel-mode drivers: 

<UL>
	<LI>It must supply a set of Dispatch routines to which the I/O Manager and/or still higher-level drivers can send IRPs for appropriate I/O operations. An SFD must support the same set of IRP_MJ_<I>XXX </I>as the storage class driver for its type of device. </LI>

	<LI>For IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL requests, it must support as many of the class driver-supported I/O control codes as its physical device can handle, and, if possible, emulate support for any remaining I/O control codes in the driver. </LI>

	<LI>It must have a <B>DriverEntry</B> routine, an <I>AddDevice</I> routine, an <I>Unload</I> routine, and Dispatch routines to handle PnP and power IRPs, and can have any other standard higher-level driver routine, such as <I>IoCompletion</I> routines, as necessary. </LI>

	<LI>It must follow the rules for processing PnP, power management, and system control IRPs.</LI>
</UL>

<P>If its device has special features, an SFD can support a set of driver-defined I/O control codes in addition to the system-required set of device-type-specific I/O control codes for <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL</A> requests. </P>
