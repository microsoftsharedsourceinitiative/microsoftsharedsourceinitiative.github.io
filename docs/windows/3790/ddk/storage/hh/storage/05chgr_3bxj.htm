<P>To support a new changer, a driver writer implements a changer miniclass driver that links to the system-supplied changer class driver. A new changer miniclass driver must be written only to support a changer for which the system does not already provide a driver. </P>

<P>Before starting to implement a new miniclass driver, you should ensure that:

<UL>
	<LI>The device is a true changer and not a serial access stacker. A changer permits media to be mounted in its drives in random order, rather than a fixed sequence, as in a stacker. </LI>

	<LI>The device's drives are not write-once optical drives such as WORM, CD-R, or DVD-R. </LI>

	<LI>The device's drives are all the same type, not a mix of types such as CD-ROM and CD-R. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Microsoft operating systems do not support write-once optical drives or changers with more than one type of drive. </P>
