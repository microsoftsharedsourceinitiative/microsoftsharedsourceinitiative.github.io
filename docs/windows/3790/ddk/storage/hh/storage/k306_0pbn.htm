<H4>Members</H4>

<DL>
<DT><B>Method</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the type of positioning to perform. This member must have one of the following values:

<DL>
<DT>TAPE_REWIND</DT>

<DD>Positions the tape at the beginning of the partition indicated in <B>Partition</B> if the media is partitioned, and to the beginning of the media if the media is not partitioned. If the media is not partitioned, <B>Partition</B> must be set to zero. The <B>Offset</B> member is ignored. </DD>

<DT>TAPE_ABSOLUTE_BLOCK</DT>

<DD>Positions the tape at the absolute block address located at the offset from the beginning specified by <B>Offset</B>. The value in the <B>Partition</B> member is ignored. </DD>

<DT>TAPE_LOGICAL_BLOCK</DT>

<DD>Positions the tape to the logical block address specified by <B>Offset</B>, relative to the beginning of the partition indicated in <B>Partition</B>. If the media is not partitioned, <B>Partition</B> must be set to zero. </DD>

<DT>TAPE_PSEUDO_LOGICAL_BLOCK</DT>

<DD>Positions the tape to the pseudological block address specified by <B>Offset</B>, relative to the beginning of the partition indicated in <B>Partition</B>. If the media is not partitioned, <B>Partition</B> must be to zero.</DD>

<DT>TAPE_SPACE_END_OF_DATA</DT>

<DD>Positions the tape at the end of the partition indicated in <B>Partition</B>, or if the media is not partitioned, at the end of the tape. The <B>Offset</B> member is ignored. </DD>

<DT>TAPE_SPACE_RELATIVE_BLOCKS</DT>

<DD>Starting from the current position, positions the tape immediately after the number of blocks specified by <B>Offset</B>. The <B>Partition</B> member is ignored. </DD>

<DT>TAPE_SPACE_FILEMARKS</DT>

<DD>Starting from the current position, positions the tape immediately after the number of filemarks specified by <B>Offset</B>. The <B>Partition</B> member is ignored. </DD>

<DT>TAPE_SPACE_SEQUENTIAL_FMKS</DT>

<DD>Starting from the current position, positions the tape immediately after the next occurrence, if any, of the number of consecutive filemarks specified by <B>Offset</B>. The <B>Partition</B> member is ignored. </DD>

<DT>TAPE_SPACE_SETMARKS</DT>

<DD>Starting from the current position, positions the tape immediately after the number of setmarks specified by <B>Offset</B>. The <B>Partition</B> member is ignored. </DD>

<DT>TAPE_SPACE_SEQUENTIAL_SMKS</DT>

<DD>Starting from the current position, positions the tape immediately after the next occurrence, if any, of the number of consecutive setmarks specified by <B>Offset</B>. The <B>Partition</B> member is ignored. </DD>
</DL>
</DD>

<DT><B>Partition</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the partition in which to set the tape's position. This member must have one of the following values:

<P>NOT_PARTITIONED (or zero)<BR>
DATA_PARTITION<BR>
DIRECTORY_PARTITION


<P>If the media is not partitioned, this member is zero. 
</DD>

<DT><B>Offset</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies an offset whose type depends on the value in <B>Method</B>. If the specified method positions the tape to a block address, <B>Offset</B> specifies the byte offset into the specified partition. If the specified method is to skip blocks, filemarks, or setmarks, <B>Offset</B> specifies the number to skip. If <B>Offset</B> is zero, the tape is positioned at the beginning of the partition. </DD>

<DT><B>Immediate</B></DT>

<DD>When set to TRUE, indicates that the target device should return status immediately. When set to FALSE, indicates that the device should return status after the operation is complete. 
</DD>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>Note that a drive or a tape may not support all <B>Method</B> values.</P>

<P>Partitions are numbered logically from 1 to N. However, a partition number does not imply a physical position on the tape. For example, partition number one might not be at the beginning of the media.</P>

<P>When the offset specifies a number of blocks, filemarks, or setmarks to position over, a positive value N in the offset causes forward positioning over N blocks, filemarks, or setmarks, halting on the end-of-partition or end-of-tape side of the block, filemark, or setmark. A zero value in the offset causes no change of position. A negative value N in the offset causes reverse positioning, toward the beginning of the partition or the tape media, over N blocks, filemarks, or setmarks, halting on the beginning-of-partition side of a block, filemark, or setmark.</P>
