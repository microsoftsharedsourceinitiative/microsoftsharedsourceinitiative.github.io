<P>Microsoft® Windows® contains two system-supplied storage port drivers: the SCSI port driver (<I>scsiport.sys</I>) and, for Windows Server&nbsp;2003 and later versions of Windows products, the Storport driver (<I>storport.sys</I>). Both port drivers work with miniport drivers and supply a set of support routines for miniport drivers to call. Support routines supplied by the SCSI port driver are described in <A HREF="k301_2ur6.htm">ScsiPort Routines</A>. Support routines supplied by the Storport driver are described in <A HREF="k301_6r02.htm">Storport Driver Support Routines</A>.</P>

<P>Each port driver communicates with its miniport drivers by calling a standard set of routines that every storage miniport driver must implement. The miniport driver routines called by the Storport driver are nearly identical to the miniport driver routines called by the SCSI port driver. Descriptions these routines can be found in <A HREF="k302_49iq.htm">SCSI Miniport Driver Routines</A> and in <A HREF="k301_15f6.htm">Storport Driver Miniport Routines</A>. </P>

<P>If you want your storage device to be supported on non-server Windows products, or on server products earlier than Windows Server&nbsp;2003, you must supply a SCSI miniport driver.</P>

<P>If you want your storage device to be supported on Windows Server&nbsp;2003 and later versions of the server product family, you can provide either a SCSI miniport driver or a Storport miniport driver.</P>

<P>The section that follows describes the Storport driver and how it differs from the SCSI port driver. </P>
