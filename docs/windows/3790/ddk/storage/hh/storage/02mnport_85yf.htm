<P>In NT-based operating systems, miniport drivers should set this entry point to NULL in the HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA (see <A HREF="02mnport_8gfb.htm">Required and Optional SCSI Miniport Routines</A>) only if either of the following conditions hold: 

<UL>
	<LI>The miniport drives an HBA to be connected on an I/O bus commonly found only in high-end, RISC-based platforms. That is, an x86-based platform running an x86-only Microsoft Windows system would not have an I/O bus of a type to support the HBA. </LI>

	<LI>The miniport drives an HBA that could be found in an x86-based platform running an x86-only Windows system, but the HBA has neither a BIOS nor an x86-only real-mode driver. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Otherwise, a miniport driver must have a <I>HwScsiAdapterState</I> routine in order to be portable across NT-based operating systems and x86-only Microsoft Windows systems. </P>

<P>A <I>HwScsiAdapterState</I> routine is responsible for saving and restoring the state of its HBA, as requested by the x86-only system during transitions between x86 real and protected processor mode. </P>

<P>See <A HREF="k302_1702.htm">HwScsiAdapterState</A> for more information. </P>
