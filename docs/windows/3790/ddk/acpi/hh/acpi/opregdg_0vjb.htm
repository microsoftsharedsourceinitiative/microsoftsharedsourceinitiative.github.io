<P>When a function driver registers an operation region handler, it specifies how an operation region can be accessed. The two access types are:

<OL>
	<LI><I>Cooked access</I>
<P>Cooked access supports transfer of information from an ACPI device to the device's function driver, but not from the function driver to the device. Only the system-supplied ACPI driver modifies the data in an operation region. The function driver can read the data in an operation region, but it must not modify the data. When called, an operation region handler transfers bytes in the operation region to and from the ACPI driver's data buffer. The ACPI driver manages accessing the correct bytes to read and write a data field in an operation region.
</LI>

	<LI><I>Raw access</I>
<P>Raw access is a feature under development that will be documented in a future release of the Microsoft® Windows® DDK. Raw access will support bidirectional transfer of information between an ACPI device's function driver and the ACPI device. With raw access, both the device's function driver and the ACPI driver will be able to read and write data in the device's operation region.
</LI>
