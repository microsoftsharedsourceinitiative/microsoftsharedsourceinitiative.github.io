<P>Server appliances are headless, fixed-function devices. Because server appliances are headless (that is, they have no video hardware, monitor, keyboard, and mouse), they must be accessed remotely through a network connection. Therefore, if the network fails, server appliances become inaccessible. </P>

<P>However, if you design your server appliance using Microsoft® Windows® Server 2003 and later, you can also design in server high availability hardware features that improve the user experience. These hardware features make the server appliance available to users even if the network fails. They provide a simple local user interface and a method for the basic input/output system (BIOS) and operating system to detect whether the operating system is able to boot. If the operating system cannot boot, the BIOS can fail over to alternate operating systems. </P>

<P>The following figure shows an architectural overview for a server appliance. The shaded areas represent components that a hardware vendor can supply. </P>
