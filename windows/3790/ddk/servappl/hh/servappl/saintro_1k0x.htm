<P>The NVRAM miniport driver must define a device extension structure that contains information about the hardware resources and the current state of the NVRAM device. This structure includes the following members: 

<UL>
	<LI>A pointer to a DEVICE_OBJECT object. The NVRAM miniport driver assigns this object pointer to the NVRAM device's object pointer during initialization. The SA port driver creates the NVRAM device's object and passes a pointer to this object in a call to the miniport driver's <A HREF="samini_55pd.htm"><I>SaHwInitialize</I></A> function. </LI>

	<LI>An internal buffer to hold system status, which is transferred between the requesting application and the NVRAM device. </LI>

	<LI>A variable to hold the size of the internal buffer.</LI>

	<LI>A variable to hold a flag that indicates whether the system status was received from the NVRAM device.</LI>

	<LI>An object, such as a spin lock or a mutex, to synchronize access to members of this device extension structure.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The device extension can also contain additional members to support queries or data transfer operations that are beyond the basic functionality of an NVRAM miniport driver.</P>

<P>The NVRAM miniport driver's callback functions subsequently use this device extension structure to execute I/O operations with the NVRAM device. </P>
