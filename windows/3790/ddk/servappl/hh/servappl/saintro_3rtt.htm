<P>The server availability driver samples in the DDK work with virtual devices rather than actual devices. These virtual devices consist of a keypad and a local display and are implemented as the <I>sagui.exe</I> application. Because these virtual devices cannot generate interrupts for their sample drivers, the drivers do not implement <A HREF="samini_9vkx.htm"><I>SaInterruptServiceRoutine</I></A> and <A HREF="samini_3jfl.htm"><I>SaIsrForDpcRoutine</I></A> functions.</P>

<P>The DDK contains the following server availability driver samples:

<UL>
	<LI><I>mskeypad</I>
<P>This sample keypad miniport driver reads key presses that are submitted from a virtual keypad device. Because this virtual device cannot interrupt the driver, the virtual device submits an IOCTL_VDRIVER_INIT code to the driver when there is key-press information to read.
</LI>

	<LI><I>msnvram</I>
<P>This sample nonvolatile random access memory (NVRAM) miniport driver reads and writes information to the registry to simulate an NVRAM device. 
</LI>

	<LI><I>msdisp</I>
<P>This sample local display miniport driver writes display messages to a virtual local display device. This sample driver creates a named event on which the virtual device waits. When the driver sets the event to the signaled state, the virtual device is notified to begin to receive display messages from the driver. Because this virtual device cannot interrupt the driver, the virtual device submits an IOCTL_VDRIVER_INIT code to the driver to indicate that the virtual device is ready to receive display messages.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>For details on these samples, see the source code for each sample in the DDK. </P>
