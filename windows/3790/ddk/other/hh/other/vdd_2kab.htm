<P>Many devices have a ROM that occupies a particular range in the device’s memory space. If a VDD knows it will not be accessing the ROM, it can call <B>VDDIncludeMem</B> to allow the VDM to use the address range of the ROM as an MS-DOS UMB. A VDD most likely calls <B>VDDIncludeMem </B>if it has chosen to implement application-based intercepts, as described in <A HREF="vdd_9cz7.htm">Application-Based Intercepts</A>, where the VDD replaces most of the functionality originally in the device ROM. Since the ROM is no longer needed, its memory space can be reused by the VDM.</P>
