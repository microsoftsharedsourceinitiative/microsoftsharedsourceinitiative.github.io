<P>This strategy involves modifying the MS-DOS application or its 16-bit driver to intercept the device access at a very high level and route it directly to the VDD, which routes the request to the appropriate kernel-mode driver. In addition to modifying the original application or driver, you must also write a VDD and kernel-mode device driver. Control calls in the original driver that access the hardware directly (I/O port or memory mapped accesses) are replaced by control calls to the VDD. In turn, the VDD calls the kernel-mode device driver.</P>

<P>The following figure shows how application-based intercepts flow through the various levels of the system from the application to the hardware. <B> </B>.</P>
