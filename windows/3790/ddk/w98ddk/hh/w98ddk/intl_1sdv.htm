<TD width=43%>IME_ESC_PRIVATE_FIRST </TD>
<TD width=57%>The escape between IME_ESC_PRIVATE_FIRST and IME_ESC_PRIVATE_LAST is reserved for the IME. The IME can freely use these escape functions for its own purposes. </TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>IME_ESC_SEQUENCE_TO_INTERNAL </TD>
<TD width=57%>The escape is Chinese specific. An application that needs to run under all Asian platforms should not use it. It is for the Chinese EUDC editor. The <I>lpData</I> parameter is the sequence code, and the return value is the character code for this sequence code. Typically, the Chinese IME encodes its reading character codes into sequence 1 to n. </TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>IME_ESC_GET_EUDC_DICTIONARY </TD>
<TD width=57%>The escape is Chinese specific. An application that needs to run under all Asian platforms should not use it. It is for the Chinese EUDC editor. On return from the function, the <I>lpData</I> is filled with the full path file name of the EUDC dictionary. The size of the buffer pointed to by <I>lpData</I> should be greater or equal to 80 * sizeof(TCHAR). </TD>

<TD width=43%>IME_ESC_SET_EUDC_DICTIONARY </TD>
<TD width=57%>The escape is Chinese specific. An application that needs to run under all Asian platforms should not use it. It is for the Chinese EUDC editor. On return from the function, the <I>lpData</I> is the full path file name of the EUDC dictionary. The path name should be less than 80 * sizeof(TCHAR). </TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>IME_ESC_MAX_KEY </TD>
<TD width=57%>The escape is Chinese specific. An application that needs to run under all Asian platforms should not use it. It is for the Chinese EUDC editor. The return value is the maximum key stokes for an EUDC character. </TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>IME_ESC_IME_NAME </TD>
<TD width=57%>The escape is Chinese specific. An application that needs to run under all Asian platforms should not use it. It is for the Chinese EUDC editor. On return from the function, the <I>lpData</I> is the IME name to be displayed on the EUDC editor. The size of the buffer pointed to by <I>lpData</I> should be greater or equal to 16 * sizeof(TCHAR). </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>IME_ESC_SYNC_HOTKEY </TD>
<TD width=57%>The escape is (Traditional) Chinese specific. An application that needs to run under all Asian platforms should not use it. It is to synchronize between different IMEs. The input parameter <I>lpData</I> is the IME private hot key ID. If this ID is zero, this IME should check every private hot key ID it concerns. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>IME_ESC_HANJA_MODE </TD>
<TD width=57%>The escape is Korean specific. An application that needs to run under all Asian platforms should not use it. It is for conversion from Hangeul to Hanja. The input parameter <I>lpData</I> is filled with Hangeul character which will be converted to Hanja, and its null-terminated string. When the application needs to convert any Hangeul character to Hanja character in the same method of Hanja conversion with the composition character present, the application just requests this function and the IME sets itself as Hanja conversion mode. </TD>
