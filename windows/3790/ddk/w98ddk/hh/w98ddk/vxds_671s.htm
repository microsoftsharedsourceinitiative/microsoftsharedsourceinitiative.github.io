<P>You create a device driver either by adapting a sample driver, or writing a driver from scratch. You can write Windows device drivers in assembly language or in a high-level language such as the C language. Assembly language programmers can use the CMACROS assembly-language macro package. </P>

<P>To create a device driver, you need to: 

<OL>
	<LI>Read the section in this documentation that describes the driver for your type of device. </LI>

	<LI>Write the required driver functions. </LI>

	<LI>Create and compile the required resources. </LI>

	<LI>Every device driver must have at least a VERSIONINFO resource that contains the version stamp for the driver. Setup and Control Panel both look for this resource when installing drivers. </LI>

	<LI>Create a module-definition file that identifies the appropriate module name for your driver, and export the required functions. </LI>

	<LI>Assemble and link your driver. </LI>

	<LI>Test your driver using the debugging version of Windows. </LI>

	<LI>Create an installation file (*.INF) for your driver and related files. </LI>

	<LI>Create your final distribution disk or disks. </LI>
</OL>
