<P>Class drivers are drivers that receive IRPs and translate the IRPs into a private interface with miniport drivers. An example is the ScsiPort class driver that receives IRPs and translates the IRPs into SRBs. </P>

<P>In order to provide the extensibility functionality that is at the heart of WMI, a class driver needs to interrogate its miniport drivers for WMI data blocks that they want to support and make the IoWMI<I>xxxx</I> call on their behalf. </P>
