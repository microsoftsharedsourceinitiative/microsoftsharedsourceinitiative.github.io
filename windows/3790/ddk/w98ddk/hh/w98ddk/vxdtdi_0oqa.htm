<P>The <B>NDIS_BUFFER</B> structure is defined in NDIS.H. In Windows NT/Windows 2000, <B>NDIS_BUFFER </B>structures are MDLs, but in the VxD environment, they are essentially buffer descriptors consisting of a length, pointer, and a next field. Chains of <B>NDIS_BUFFER</B> structures may be used to pass in scatter/gather lists of buffers for sending and receiving. NDIS_BUFFER chains must be NULL terminated. Both the <B>NDIS_BUFFER</B> structure itself and the buffer  pointed to by the <B>NDIS_BUFFER</B> structure must be locked down and validated before being passed to the transport. VxD TDI clients may use the macros and functions for managing buffers provided by the NDIS wrapper (ndis.386) and described in the NDIS 3.0 specification, or they may create and initialize <B>NDIS_BUFFER </B>structures themselves. <B>NDIS_BUFFER</B> chains submitted to the transport must not be altered while the request with which they were submitted is outstanding.</P>
