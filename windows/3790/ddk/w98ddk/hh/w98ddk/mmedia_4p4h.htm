<P>Sent to an audio mixer device driver to allocate a specified device for use by a client application. This message is normally sent to an audio mixer driver in response to a <B>mixerOpen</B> call. Applications using the audio mixer functions are not required to open a device to use it, but they must do so if they desire line and control notification callbacks.

<P>The driver must determine the number of clients allowed to use a particular device. Once a device is opened for the maximum number of clients that it supports, that driver should return MMSYSERR_ALLOCATED for any additional open requests. </P>

<P>A mixer driver must be written to allow multiple opens on a single device (thus allowing more than one client to receive notifications). </P>

<P>An audio mixer driver must support this message. The Mixer Manager will validate the following parameters for the MXDM_OPEN message before calling the driver. Your driver does not need to check for the following conditions: 

<OL>
	<LI><I>dwParam1</I> will contain a valid pointer to a <B>MIXEROPENDESC</B> structure. This structure will be at least large enough to hold the base <B>MIXEROPENDESC</B> structure members. All members of this structure will be valid. </LI>

	<LI><I>dwParam2</I> will be a valid combination of flags. </LI>
</OL>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mixer Manager might combine several opens and closes from many applications. During debugging, if you notice that only one MXDM_OPEN message gets sent even if more than one application opens the device, the Mixer Manager probably has combined the open requests. </P>
