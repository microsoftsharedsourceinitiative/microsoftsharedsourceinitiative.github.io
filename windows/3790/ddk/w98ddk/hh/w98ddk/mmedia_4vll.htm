<P>Sent to an Audio Compression Manager (ACM) driver to request details about the driver. This message is typically sent to an ACM driver in response to an <B>acmDriverDetails</B> call.

<DD>Address of the <B>ACMDRIVERDETAILS</B> structure that should be filled in with various details describing the driver. The <B>cbStruct</B> member of the <B>ACMDRIVERDETAILS</B> structure will contain the desired size, in bytes, of the details that the driver should return. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>An ACM driver must support this message. Note that this message should never fail unless the driver could not initialize. There are two possible error conditions: 

<OL>
	<LI>If <I>lParam1</I> is not a valid pointer to a <B>ACMDRIVERDETAILS</B> structure. </LI>

	<LI>If the <B>cbStruct</B> member of the <B>ACMDRIVERDETAILS</B> structure is less than four; in this case, there is not enough room to return the number of bytes filled in. </LI>
</OL>

<P>Because these two error conditions are easily defined, the ACM will catch these errors and will not send the ACMDM_DRIVER_DETAILS message. The driver does not need to check for these conditions. </P>
