<P><B>IRP_MJ_CREATE</B> is received by a device object when a filter, filter pin, or master clock file handle is created. The only method to establish communication is through an open file handle on one of these objects:

<UL>
	<LI>A file handle of a filter is created when an instance of the filter is required. </LI>

	<LI>A pin file handle is created when a pin connection is established. </LI>

	<LI>A master clock file handle is created when a filter pin is chosen as the master clock for a filter graph, assuming it supports such a clock.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Although the medium for pin communication may not use IRPs, the communication is always established through file handles (actually, reference counts on file objects). There are standard functions for creating file handles for pins so that all handles point to the same device object created by PnP either for a hardware device or for an instance of a software device.</P>
