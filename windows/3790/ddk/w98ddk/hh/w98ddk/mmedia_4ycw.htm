<P>An ACM driver must support this message if it supports conversion operations. Note that the following parameters for the ACMDM_STREAM_OPEN message will be validated before calling the driver: 

<UL>
	<LI>The <I>lParam1</I> parameter will contain a valid pointer to an <B>ACMDRVSTREAMINSTANCE</B> structure with all members validated. All members of this structure will be within the bounds defined in the documentation for the <B>ACMDRVSTREAMINSTANCE</B> structure. </LI>

	<LI>The <B>cbStruct</B> member of the <B>ACMDRVSTREAMINSTANCE</B> structure will be set to at least the size, in bytes, of the base <B>ACMDRVSTREAMINSTANCE</B> structure. </LI>

	<LI>No invalid flag combinations will be specified in the <B>fdwOpen</B> member. </LI>

	<LI>A driver will never be called to open a conversion stream for conversions for the same format tag unless the driver sets the ACMDRIVERDETAILS_SUPPORTF_CONVERTER flag in the <B>fdwSupport</B> member of the <B>ACMDRIVERDETAILS</B> structure returned by the driver during the ACMDM_DRIVER_DETAILS message. </LI>

	<LI>A driver will never be called to open a conversion stream for conversions between two different format tags unless the driver sets the ACMDRIVERDETAILS_SUPPORTF_CODEC flag in the <B>fdwSupport</B> member of the <B>ACMDRIVERDETAILS</B> structure returned by the driver during the ACMDM_DRIVER_DETAILS message. </LI>

	<LI>A driver will never be called to open a conversion stream with a filter unless the driver sets the ACMDRIVERDETAILS_SUPPORTF_FILTER flag in the <B>fdwSupport</B> member of the <B>ACMDRIVERDETAILS</B> structure returned by the driver during the ACMDM_DRIVER_DETAILS message. </LI>

	<LI>A driver will never be called to open an asynchronous conversion stream unless the driver sets the ACMDRIVERDETAILS_SUPPORTF_ASYNC flag in the <B>fdwSupport</B> member of the <B>ACMDRIVERDETAILS</B> structure returned by the driver during the ACMDM_DRIVER_DETAILS message. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The driver does not need to check for these conditions. </P>

<P>If the ACM_STREAMOPENF_QUERY flag is specified in the <B>fdwOpen</B> member of the <B>ACMDRVSTREAMINSTANCE</B> structure, the driver should only return whether the conversion stream can be opened by the driver; but the conversion stream will not be opened. The driver should not allocate any instance data in conjunction with this flag. </P>

<P>If the ACM_STREAMOPENF_NONREALTIME flag is not specified in the <B>fdwOpen</B> member of the <B>ACMDRVSTREAMINSTANCE</B> structure, the driver should only succeed the message if the conversion can be done in real time. The definition of real time is highly dependent on your interpretation, though good judgment should be used here. If the driver's conversion is computationally expensive, the driver should not succeed a real-time conversion stream open request. An example of a real-time conversion client is the wave mapper, where data is converted as it is being played or recorded. </P>
