<P>The following figure shows the system-supplied and vendor-supplied components that can be involved in printing over USB and parallel ports on Windows operating systems. </P>

<P><B>Windows USB and Parallel Port Printing Architecture</B></P>

<P>The only required vendor-supplied component is the high-level printer driver, which is in the layer above the spooler. A vendor can optionally supply a language monitor that is in the layer between the spooler and <I>usbmon.dll</I> (for USB) or <I>localmon.dll</I> (for parallel port).</P>

<P>The preceding figure shows a vendor-supplied kernel-mode USB print driver (labeled IHV-supplied USB Print Driver) that is in the layer above the USB driver stack, and which consists of <I>usbhub.sys</I>, <I>usbd.sys</I>, and some layers underneath. In the past, a vendor-supplied USB print driver was needed for USB printing on Windows&nbsp;98 operating systems, which did not include an in-box kernel-mode USB print driver. </P>

<P>Printer vendors can now redistribute the Microsoft-supplied USB print driver and port monitor, <I>usbprint.sys</I> and <I>usbmon.dll</I>, for installation on Windows&nbsp;98 systems. Microsoft is encouraging vendors to redistribute <I>usbprint.sys</I> and <I>usbmon.dll</I> rather than writing their own USB print drivers and port monitors.</P>
