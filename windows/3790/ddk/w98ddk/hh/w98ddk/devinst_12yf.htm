<P>Note that several classes of devices -- namely printers and network adapters -- have INF file extensions specific to those devices which are not described in this section. For a description of the printer INF extensions, see the topic Router and Local Print Provider in the Windows 95 DDK help reference for the print spooler and printer drivers. For a description of the network INF extensions, see the topic Network Driver Installer in the Windows 95 DDK help reference for networks. </P>

<P>There are also some special cases of INF files, such as INF files for multifunction boards, that require you to add items to the INF file you create with Infedit. </P>
