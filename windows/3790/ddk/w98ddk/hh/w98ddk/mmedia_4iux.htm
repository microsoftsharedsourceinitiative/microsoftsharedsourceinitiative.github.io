<P>Audio hardware that has waveform, MIDI, and mixer capabilities typically uses one driver to access its hardware functions. While the driver has separate entry-points for each audio function, the driver can use a single <B>DriverProc</B> entry point to handle the system messages. </P>

<P>If the same hardware supports video capture as well as video compression, you can combine both of these functions into one DLL and use a single <B>DriverProc</B> entry point to service them. The shared entry point simplifies the coordination of the different functions. </P>
