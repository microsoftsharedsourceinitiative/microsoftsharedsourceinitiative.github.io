<P>The DIB Engine's software cursor supports color cursors. A color cursor consists of a monochrome AND mask followed by an XOR device dependent bitmap. For example, on an 8 bpp display, the color cursor passed to the display driver on the <B>SetCursor</B> call would look like: </P>

<PRE>csHotX        DW    ?
csHotY        DW    ?
csWidth       DW    ?
csHeight      DW    ?
csWidthBytes  DW    ?
csColor       DW    ?            ; 0101h = mono, 0801h = 8bpp, etc.
csANDBits     DB    4*8 dup (?)  ; 32x32 bit mask = 4 bytes/row 
                                 ; with 8 rows
csXORBitS     DB    32*8 dup (?)    ; 32x32 pixels = 32 bytes/row 
                                 ; with 8 rows
 </PRE>

<P>Note that the device dependent portion of the cursor is still XORed onto the screen. </P>

<P>A driver informs the system that it is color-cursor capable by setting the C1_COLORCURSOR bit in the <B>dpCaps1</B> field of the <B>GDIINFO</B> structure passed back to GDI <B>Enable</B> is called to get the capability bits. The DIB engine does not set this bit even though it supports color cursors. Minidrivers must set this bit explicitly. </P>

<P>If the driver does not set this bit, it will never be passed a color cursor. If the driver sets this bit, it can receive either monochrome or color cursors. </P>

<P>Most minidrivers should just let the DIB Engine's software cursor code handle the drawing of the color cursor. This presents special problems for drivers that have hardware monochrome cursors. A driver has to dynamically "turn off" its hardware cursor and "turn on" the DIB Engine's software cursor. </P>
