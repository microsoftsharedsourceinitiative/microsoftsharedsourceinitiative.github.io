<P>The <B>KS_VBI_FRAME_INFO</B> structure is used to extend the <B>KSSTREAM_HEADER</B> structure for VBI streams. It provides a way to return information about the frame captured, as well as providing tuning information to VBI decoders.</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>ExtendedHeaderSize</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the size of this structure.</DD>

<DT><B>dwFrameFlags</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies flags indicating additional information about the frame captured. When capturing, the driver sets this field using flags described in the following <B>Comments</B> section.</DD>

<DT><B>PictureNumber</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies a count representing the current picture number. The counter is reset to zero when the stream is placed in the Run state. </DD>

<DT><B>DropCount</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of pictures that were not captured. When capturing, the driver sets this field. This counter should be incremented whenever a frame should have been captured but was not; this condition usually arises when no buffers were available during capture. </DD>

<DT><B>TvTunerChangeInfo</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies information about the current VBI data source, including country/region code, analog video standard, and channel. This field is only valid if <B>dwFrameFlags</B> specifies the KS_VBI_FLAG_TVTUNER_CHANGE flag. </DD>

<DT><B>VBIInfoHeader</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies information about the current VBI data source, including start line, end line, sampling frequency, and video standard. This field is only valid if <B>dwFrameFlags</B> specifies the KS_VBI_FLAG_VBIINFOHEADER_CHANGE flag.
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>The <B>PictureNumber</B> member count represents the idealized count of the current picture, which is calculated in one of two ways:

<UL>
	<LI>Measure the time since the stream was started and divide by the frame duration. This method is appropriate for devices which do not provide their own clock.</LI>

	<LI>Add together the count of frames captured and the count of frame dropped. This method is appropriate for device which provide their own clock.</LI>
</UL>

<P>When calculating the <B>PictureNumber</B> and <B>DropCount</B>, it is important to use the frame duration specified when the stream is opened, which may not necessarily match the rate at which the device is actually producing images. For example, a USB camera may only produce images at 7.5 fps, but a client could open the stream at 8 fps. In this case, all calculations should use the 8 fps number. </P>

<P>The <B>dwFrameFlags</B> member is set by the driver using the following flags.</P>

<P>The <B>dwSamplingFrequency</B> member is not used by Microsoft VBI codecs, but may be used by other WDM codecs.  It must be the same as the <B>VBIInfoHeader</B>.<I>SamplingFrequency</I> member.  If a capture driver wishes to indicate a change of sampling frequency, it must set the KS_VBI_FLAG_VBIINFOHEADER_CHANGE bit in the <B>dwFrameFlags</B> member, and fill in all elements, including <B>dwSamplingFrequency</B>, in the <B>VBIInfoHeader</B> structure.</P>
