<P>Before managing the power to a device, the policy owner and device driver need to determine which power states the platform supports. The hardware and the software (device driver) each have their own capabilities. To determine which power states the platform  supports, the device driver must determine the capabilities of the hardware and then merge those capabilities with its own.</P>

<P>Device drivers can determine the supported power states using the following procedure:</P>

<P>When the bus driver creates a device node, it interrogates the hardware for its capabilities using industry standard mechanisms and sets those capabilities using the configuration manager service <A HREF="vxd-pm_2m2b.htm"><B>Set_DevNode_PowerCapabilities</B></A>. </P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this, the configuration manager initializes the capabilities to indicate that only D0&nbsp; is supported.</P>

<P>When loading, a driver (and policy holder) should decide which power states can be used on a system.</P>

<P>The ACPI driver listens for the new device's CONFIG_START message and may add additional capabilities to the new device node. </P>

<P>When the device driver receives a CONFIG_START message, it calls the configuration manager service <A HREF="vxd-pm_8lgz.htm"><B>Get_DevNode_PowerCapabilities</B></A> to determine which capabilities the hardware supports. </P>

<P>The device driver takes the result of <B>Get_DevNode_PowerCapabilities</B>, combines this with its own capabilities, and then calls <B>Set_DevNode_PowerCapabilities</B> to store the combined capabilities in the device node.</P>

<P>In summary, bus drivers call <B>Set_DevNode_PowerCapabilities</B> to set the initial capabilities when they create a device node. After loading, device drivers call <B>Get_DevNode_PowerCapabilities</B>, combine the resulting capabilities with the capabilities of the driver, and call <B>Set_DevNode_PowerCapabilities</B> with the final set of capabilities.</P>
