<P>The first time Windows 95 detects a printer connected locally to the Windows 95 computer through a parallel port, Windows 95 attempts a device ID negotiation with the printer as described in the IEEE 1284 specification. If the printer is a bi-directional printer and responds appropriately, Windows 95 will install the required printer drivers as listed in the INF file for the device. </P>

<P>The required printer drivers are determined by finding a match between the values returned by the device and the values in an INF file containing information about the required printer support. </P>
