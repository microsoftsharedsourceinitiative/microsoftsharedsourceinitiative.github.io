<P>Under Windows® 98/Me and Windows® 2000 and later, applications do not need to be changed to work with the new multimonitor support. Applications work as if there were only one display.  For example, dialog boxes that are displayed as centered on the screen do not span two monitors. Full-screen applications appear automatically on the primary display. The operating system automatically handles minimum/maximum for the display.</P>

<P>Although most applications display correctly with no problems, some applications are not designed to be placed in negative space, while other applications clip or center windows to the primary monitor. In the worst case, a particular application may need to run on the primary display only and therefore will require disabling the secondary display. The following types of applications have display problems on systems using the new multimonitor capabilities:

<UL>
	<LI>Drivers or applications that patch <I>Gdi.exe</I> or the display driver</LI>

	<LI>Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) applications</LI>

	<LI>Remote control applications</LI>
</UL>
