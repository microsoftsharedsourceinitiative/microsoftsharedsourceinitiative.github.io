<H4>Summary</H4>

<P>This service locks the specified drive for exclusive access. All I/O requests (IOR) for this drive will fail after it is locked, except those routed through the appropriate routine (returned by _IOS_LockDrive). This service cannot be used on the drive containing the swap file or non-removable media. </P>

<H4>Entry/Exit</H4>

<P>The service expects the drive number as the parameter passed in (TOS+4) and will return, in EAX, either a NULL (failure) or the entry point for all IOR into the locked drive. </P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Drive numbering starts with zero for drive letter A and counts up from there. If drive F is to be locked, for instance, you should pass in a five.</P>

<H4>Usage</H4>

<P>Following the prescribed rules for accessing IOS routines, this service function may be used to request a lock on a drive, usually removable media. The return value indicates success or failure. Failure may happen under any number of circumstances:

<UL>
	<LI>The drive is already locked </LI>

	<LI>The drive is a paging device </LI>

	<LI>The drive is not a removable device </LI>

	<LI>The drive specified does not exist </LI>
</UL>

<P>The lock, once successfully obtained, will automatically be released after a timeout period of 60 seconds if no commands are sent to the returned IOR entry point. You can call the IOR entry with an empty request to refresh the timer.</P>

<P>This service uses (writes to) EAX, ECX, EDX, and Flags.</P>
