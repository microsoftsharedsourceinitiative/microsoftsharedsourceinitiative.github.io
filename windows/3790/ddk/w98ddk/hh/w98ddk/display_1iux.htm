<H4>Call With</H4>

<P>EAX: Contains the value to output to port (on an OUT call). </P>

<P>EBX: Contains the VM handle for which the I/O is being done. </P>

<P>ECX: Contains the I/O flags (documented in VMM.INC). </P>

<P>EDX: Contains the port that the I/O is to be done to or from. </P>

<P>EBP: Points to VM's client registers. </P>

<H4>Return Values</H4>

<P>CY set indicates that the mini-VDD has done the I/O and that the Main VDD should take no further action. In this case, AL should contain the return value from the <B>IN</B> call and all registers except EBX and EBP may be destroyed. </P>

<P>NC set indicates that the mini-VDD may have taken some action but wants the Main VDD to do the default action. In this case the mini-VDD must not have destroyed ANY registers. </P>

<H4>Remarks</H4>

<P>Many chipsets tack their extended registers onto the standard VGA ports. These routines allow the mini-VDD to perform special actions on these ports. The VIDEO7 mini-VDD is a good example of virtualizing extensions to the Sequencer ports while the S3 and Cirrus mini-VDD's show how virtualization and notification via the VGA ports are implemented in a mini-VDD. Note that the action taken by the Main VDD is undefined for port indices which are greater than the standard VGA ports (0-18h for CRTC, 0-4 for Sequencer, 0-9 for GCR, and 0-255 for DAC ports). </P>
