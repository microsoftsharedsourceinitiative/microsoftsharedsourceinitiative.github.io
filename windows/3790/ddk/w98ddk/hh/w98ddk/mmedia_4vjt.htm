<P>Three sample ACM drivers are provided with the DDK. 

<UL>
	<LI>The <B>imaadpcm</B> sample provides a speed-optimized codec which converts between PCM and the IMA ADPCM format. This codec shows how to use several conversion routines to reduce computational requirements. It also supports a configuration dialog box, and it automatically configures itself the first time it is loaded. </LI>

	<LI>The <B>msfilter</B> sample provides a simple volume and echo filter. (Both filters are supported within the same driver.) This driver supports a custom icon and a custom About dialog box. As noted earlier, the ACM provides a default icon and About dialog box for drivers which do not provide their own; using the default About dialog box is recommended, since the driver code is simpler and smaller. </LI>

	<LI>The <B>gsm610</B> sample implements the GSM 6.10 voice encoding standard, originally developed for digital cellular-telephone encoding. It supports a configuration dialog box and automatic-configuration code. </LI>
</UL>
