<P>If you have any questions about WHQL's program or the compatibility tests after looking at the FTP sites and/or reading the faxed-back instructions, e-mail whqlinfo@microsoft.com. </P>

<P>Contact Microsoft Developer Support Services to answer technical questions about device driver development, not WHQL. For example, sites that have a support contract with Microsoft, such as a Premier, Priority, or MSDN Level II support contract, should call their regular support number and ask for DDK support for OEMs and IHVs. After you have submitted your device and device driver for WHQL testing, WHQL test engineers will take the initiative to contact you about specific problems your device is having with the WHQL tests. </P>

<P>If your site does not have a support contract with Microsoft, or for answers to general questions about the Microsoft support options, telephone 1-800-936-3500. </P>
