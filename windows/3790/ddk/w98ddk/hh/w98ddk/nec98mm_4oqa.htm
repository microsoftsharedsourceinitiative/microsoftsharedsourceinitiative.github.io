<P>Accelerators other than the primary will be the secondary. However, they may not be used for the desktop due to the following limitations:

<UL>
	<LI><B>Limitations due to shared resources</B>
<P>Accelerators that share resources, such as VRAM, with the core graph cannot be used at the same time as the core graph. This means the accelerator cannot be used as a secondary display adapter.
</LI>

	<LI><B>Limitations due to a common CRT output</B>
<P>Accelerators that share the CRT output (CRT connector) with the core graph cannot be used as a secondary display adapter because they cannot be used at the same time as the core graph.

<P>(If an external accelerator is set as the primary display adapter, the internal accelerator cannot be used because the core graph output needs to be allocated to the external accelerator.)
</LI>

	<LI><B>Accelerators that use Vflatd.vxd</B>
<P>When accessing VRAM, accelerators that use <I>vflatd.vxd</I> to switch banks cannot be used as secondary, according to the accelerator CHIP specification.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>For secondary display adapters that cannot be used as a desktop due to the reasons previously listed, a “!” is displayed in the device manager.</P>

<P>Core graph with the primary as the accelerator does not display “!” or “x” in the device manager.</P>
