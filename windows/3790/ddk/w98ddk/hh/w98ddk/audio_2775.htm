<P>For information about how to certify your audio device driver with the Windows Hardware Quality Labs, see Device Driver Certification in the Microsoft Windows 95 DDK Programmer's Guide. Devices that pass WHQL's certification tests are qualified to display the "Designed for Microsoft Windows 95" logo. This logo is your customer's assurance that your product will work with the Windows 95 family of products. Audio adapters that pass WHQL's certification tests are also identified in the Windows Hardware Compatibility List (HCL), and the audio adapter drivers are distributed free through the Windows Driver Library (WDL). </P>
