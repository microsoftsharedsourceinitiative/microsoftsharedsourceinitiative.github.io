<P>In some cases it is possible to create a higher resolution than a native one by vertically interlacing graphics (rendering each block of graphics data in two passes). In order to accomplish this, the printer must support a vertical cursor-movement command that uses a resolution at least twice as fine as the native vertical-graphics resolution being used. The Universal Printer Driver accomplishes this by sending the first block of raster data as normal, but during the second pass, the print-head position is incremented in the y-direction by a value that is less than or equal to the height of a single pin or jet. In order to render bitmaps correctly, the Universal Printer Driver requires the number of pins used by the printer for interlaced graphics. If the height of a block of graphics data is less than the height of the specified pins, the Universal Printer Driver will add null graphics data to the block.</P>

<P>An example of this is found in many 9-pin dot-matrix drivers. Typically, a 9-pin printer will support a 240 X 72 dpi resolution as its highest native mode, but also has a vertical-movement command that operates in 1/144 inch. The Universal Printer Driver may support a 240 X 144 dpi resolutions if the driver sets sPinsPerPass to 8 (the number of pins fired in one pass), sets sNPins to 16 (the number of pins fired in two passes), and supports the 1/144-inch vertical command.</P>

<P>For the Diconix 150 Plus printer, the sNPins box contains the value <B>8</B>; this is the number of jets used by the printer for noninterlaced graphics.</P>

<P>For the HP LaserJet IIP printer, the sNPins box contains the value <B>1</B>.</P>
