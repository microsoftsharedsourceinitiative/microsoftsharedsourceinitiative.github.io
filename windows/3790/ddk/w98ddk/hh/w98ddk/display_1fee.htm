<P>Nothing. </P>

<H4>Return Values</H4>

<P>EDI contains the VM handle of the Blue Screen Message Mode pseudo-VM. ESI contains the VM handle of the Forced Planar Mode pseudo-VM. </P>

<H4>Remarks</H4>

<P>This function can only be called up to and including the <B>Init_Complete </B>phase of VxD initialization. It will cause a fatal page fault if called after <B>Init_Complete</B>. </P>

<P>The VDD has two special "pseudo-VM's" that are used by the VDD to set special states. The first is used to contain the states for the blue-screen message mode VM which is displayed when Windows encounters a serious problem. This blue-screen message mode is displayed in VGA mode 3 in non-East Asian versions of Windows 95 and in Mode 12h in East Asian DBCS versions of Windows 95. The second is a VM containing the 4 plane MemC state (such as that in Mode 12h). These "pseudo VM" handles are sometimes passed to the mini-VDD during <B>RESTORE_REGISTERS</B> calls. The mini-VDD should retrieve these special VM handles at <B>MiniVDD_Dynamic_Init</B> time and then compare against them during the <B>RESTORE_REGISTERS</B> calls. The VIDEO7.VXD sample mini-VDD contains an example of how these pseudo-VM's have their register states saved at <B>Init_Complete </B>time and how <B>RESTORE_REGISTERS</B> uses the pseudo VM handles to properly restore the state of the blue screen message mode. </P>
