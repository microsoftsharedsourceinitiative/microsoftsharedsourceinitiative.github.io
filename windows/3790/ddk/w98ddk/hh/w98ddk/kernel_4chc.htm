<P><I>Power handler services are intended for use by Configuration Manager only</I>. Virtual devices that require notification of power changes should install a message hook procedure using the <B>_SHELL_HookSystemBroadcast</B> service. </P>

<P>A power handler is a device-driver-supplied routine that carries out power-related tasks during power suspension and resumption. VPOWERD calls all registered power handlers as part of its normal sequence of shutting down and starting up power. </P>

<P>VPOWERD typically schedules an application-time event, using the <B>SHELL_CallAtAppyTime</B> service, when the request to suspend occurs. Within the application-time event, VPOWERD calls each handler once for each POWERFUNC_SUSPEND value. It orders the calls such that all handlers receive a POWERFUNC_SUSPEND_PHASE1 call before any receives a POWERFUNC_SUSPEND_PHASE2 call and so on. </P>

<P>When power is resumed, VPOWERD calls each handler once for each POWERFUNC_RESUME value. It orders the calls such that all handlers receive a POWERFUNC_SUSPEND_PHASE2 call before any receives a POWERFUNC_SUSPEND_PHASE1 call. </P>

<P>VPOWERD calls the handlers in the order specified by their initialization order, as given when a handler is registered. The PFG_REVERSE is set for the suspend messages and not for the resume messages. That is, VPOWERD normally calls the suspend in reverse load order, like a shutdown, so that the highest priority devices get suspended last yet resume first. </P>

<P>If at any point a handler fails a call, VPOWERD restores the system to the previous state. For example, if a handler rejects a POWERFUNC_SUSPEND_PHASE2 call, VPOWERD makes POWERFUNC_RESUME_PHASE2 and subsequent POWERFUNC_RESUME_PHASE1 calls to all handlers that had previously accepted the suspension. </P>
