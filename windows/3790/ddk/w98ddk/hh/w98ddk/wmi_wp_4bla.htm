<P>The core infrastructure for supporting WMI for a WDM driver will ship with Windows®&nbsp;98. Windows&nbsp;98 will also include WMI support in the NDIS class driver. This means that NDIS miniport driver writers (such as NIC hardware vendors) can leverage WMI. An IHV or OEM writing a Windows&nbsp;98 driver that receives IRPs can also leverage WMI. </P>

<P>The Windows&nbsp;2000 Beta 1 shipped with core WMI support as well as WMI support in the NDIS class driver and the SCSI port driver. The diskperf driver, which shipped with the Windows&nbsp;NT® 4.0 DDK, has been updated to report its data using WMI.</P>
