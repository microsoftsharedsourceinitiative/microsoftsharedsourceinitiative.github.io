<H3><A NAME="_pss_2759"></A>Compressor Configuration</H3>

<P>Video compression and decompression drivers can receive a series of configuration messages. System configuration messages are typically sent by the Drivers option of Control Panel to configure the hardware. Video compression and decompression specific configuration messages are typically initiated by the client-application or from dialog boxes displayed by your driver. Your driver should use these messages to configure the driver. </P>

<H4>Configuration Messages Sent by the System</H4>

<P>Installable drivers can supply a configuration dialog box for users to access through the Drivers option in Control Panel. If your driver supports different options, it should allow user configuration. Any hardware-related settings should be stored in a section with the same name as the driver in the user's SYSTEM.INI file. </P>

<P>Like other installable drivers, your driver will receive DRV_CONFIGURE and DRV_QUERYCONFIGURE messages from the Drivers option of Control Panel. If your driver controls hardware that needs to be configured, it should return a nonzero value for the DRV_QUERYCONFIGURE system message and display a hardware configuration dialog box for the DRV_CONFIGURE system message. </P>

<H4>Messages for Configuring the Driver State</H4>

<P>The video compression and decompression specific configuration messages are typically initiated by the client-application or from dialog boxes displayed by your driver. Your driver should use these messages to configure the driver. </P>

<P>If your driver is configurable, it should support the ICM_CONFIGURE message for driver configuration. In addition, it should also use this message to set parameters for compression or decompression. Any options the user selects in the dialog box displayed for ICM_CONFIGURE should be saved as part of the state information referenced by the ICM_GETSTATE and ICM_SETSTATE messages. </P>

<P>The ICM_GETSTATE and ICM_SETSTATE messages query and set the internal state of your compression or decompression driver. State information is device dependent and your driver must define its own data structure for it. While the client-application reserves a memory block for the information, it will obtain the size needed for the memory block from your driver. If your driver receives ICM_GETSTATE with a NULL pointer for <I>dwParam1</I>, the client-application is requesting that your driver return the size of its state information. Conversely, if your driver receives ICM_GETSTATE with <I>dwParam1</I> pointing to a block of memory, and <I>dwParam2</I> specifying the size of the memory block, the client-application is requesting that your driver transfer the state information to the memory block. </P>

<P>When your driver receives ICM_SETSTATE with <I>dwParam1</I> pointing to a block of memory, and <I>dwParam2</I> specifying the size of the memory block, the client-application is requesting that your driver restore its configuration from the state information contained in the memory block. Before setting the state, your driver should verify the state information applies to your driver. One technique for verifying the data is to reserve the first DWORD in the state data structure for the four-character code used to identify your driver. If you set this DWORD for data returned for ICM_GETSTATE, you can use it to verify the data supplied with ICM_SETSTATE. If ICM_SETSTATE has a NULL pointer for <I>dwParam1</I>, it indicates that your driver should return to its default state. </P>

<P>State information should not contain any data that is absolutely required for data decompression-any such data should be part of the format you return for the ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT message. For information on the ICM_DECOMPRESS_GET_FORMAT message, see . </P>

<H4>Messages Used to Interrogate the Driver</H4>

<P>The client-application sends the ICM_ABOUT message to display your driver's about box. If the client-application sets <I>dwParam1</I> to -1, it wants to know if your driver supports display of an about box. Your driver returns ICERR_OK if it does, and it returns ICERR_UNSUPPORTED if it does not. Your driver should only display an about box if the client-application specifies a window handle in <I>dwParam1</I>. The window handle indicates the parent of the dialog box. </P>

<P>The client-application uses the ICM_GETINFO message to obtain a description of your driver. Your driver should respond to this message by filling in the ICINFO structure it receives with the message. The flags your driver sets in the structure tells the client-application what capabilities the driver supports. </P>
