<P>During the query phase, the configuration manager interrogates each currently loaded device driver to determine whether its device can be turned off (or put into some other low power state).</P>

<P>The configuration manager queries each driver (in sequence from children toward the root) by sending a CONFIG_TEST_SET_POWERSTATE_D<I>x</I> message. The configuration manager determines which power state to use (<I>x</I> = 1, 2, or 3) by looking at the capabilities for each device. </P>

<P>If the device is enabled for wake up, the configuration manager attempts to put the device in the lowest power state from which the device can support wake up. </P>

<P>If the device is not enabled for wake up, the configuration manager puts the device in the lowest power state that the device supports.</P>

<P>Upon receiving a CONFIG_TEST_SET_POWERSTATE_D<I>x</I> message, each driver determines whether it can go into a system sleep state and returns success or failure accordingly.</P>

<P>Devices should only fail this query if user data loss will occur when the system goes to sleep. </P>

<P>If a driver returns success, it must stop any activity on the device that would prevent the machine from going to sleep (any activity that would cause the driver to report failure to a CONFIG_TEST_SET_POWERSTATE_D<I>x</I> message). </P>

<P>If any device driver fails a query, the configuration manager attempts higher device power states (which may require higher system power states) until it finds a state that works, or it runs out of states. If the configuration manager runs out of power states, it gives up and sends a CONFIG_TEST_SET_POWERSTATE_D<I>x</I>_FAILED message to inform drivers that the system is not going to sleep. When drivers receive this message, they can resume normal activity.</P>
