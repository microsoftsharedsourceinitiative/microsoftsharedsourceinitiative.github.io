<P>In order to run the UniTool application, you'll need to copy certain files from the Microsoft® Windows® Device Driver Kit onto your hard disk. Among these files are UNITOOL.EXE, UNITOOL.INF, and UNITOOL.HLP. The first file is the UniTool application, the second is an information file, and the third is a help file. Because some of these files are compressed, use the expand command to decompress them as you copy them to your hard disk. </P>

<P class=proch><B><IMG SRC="../images/wedge.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Use the following procedure</B>

<OL>
	<LI>Copy EXPAND.EXE from the root directory of the minidriver disk to your TOOLS directory on your hard drive, and make sure your path includes this directory. Make sure that the TOOLS directory appears before your DOS directory in the path (MS-DOS® 5.0 has its own expand command).</LI>

	<LI>Copy the include files provided on the disk to the INC directory on your hard drive. These files are compressed; you must use the expand command to decompress the files:<BR>
expand a:\INC\*.* c:\INC<BR>
Make sure that your MS-DOS environment variable, INCLUDE, is set to INC.</LI>

	<LI>Copy the library files provided on the disk to the LIB directory on your hard drive. These files are compressed as well. To expand the files, type:<BR>
expand a:\LIB\*.* c:\LIB<BR>
Make sure that your MS-DOS environment variable, LIB, is set to LIB.</LI>

	<LI>Create a directory on your hard drive called UNITOOL, and copy the files UNITOOL.EXE and UNITOOL.HLP, which are located in the UNITOOL directory on the Minidriver disk to the UNITOOL directory on your hard drive. These files are not compressed. Also, update your MS-DOS path to include this UNITOOL directory.</LI>

	<LI>Copy the file UNITOOL.INF located in the UNITOOL directory on the minidriver disk to your WINDOWS directory. This file must be copied to the WINDOWS directory on your computer. It is not compressed.</LI>
