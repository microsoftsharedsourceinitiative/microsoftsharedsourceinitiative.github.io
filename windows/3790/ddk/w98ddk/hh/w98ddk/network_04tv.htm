<P>A single dialog is provided that lists all the network connections (the disconnect dialog in Win31). </P>

<P>The dialog contains a list box which contains the current drive connections as returned by all NPs. The list is sorted by drive letter and the rightmost column displays the network name as returned by the NP. Initial selection is on the first item of the listbox, which is a single-select listbox. </P>

<P>Hitting "OK" disconnects selected items in the listbox &amp; dismisses the dialog. </P>

<P>Persistent but unavailable connections are specifically indicated as such. Deleting (removing) a connection removes the persistence of the connection. All deletions are attempted with no force, if that fails a warning is put up and user may proceed with force if so desired. </P>
