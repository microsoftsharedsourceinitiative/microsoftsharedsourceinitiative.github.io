<P>When using a Windows 95 driver or a driver that does not support the multimonitor feature for Windows 98, the following limitations apply:

<UL>
	<LI>When a driver that does not support multimonitor is used as the primary, “Use as desktop” cannot be set for other display adapters (secondary).</LI>

	<LI>When a driver that does not support multimonitor is used as a secondary “Use as desktop” cannot be set for the display adapter that uses this driver. (Other display adapters can use the multimonitor feature.)</LI>
</UL>

<P>In addition, it must be determined which display driver is calling the function within the baseVDD interface, because several display drivers are operating simultaneously in a multimonitor environment.</P>
