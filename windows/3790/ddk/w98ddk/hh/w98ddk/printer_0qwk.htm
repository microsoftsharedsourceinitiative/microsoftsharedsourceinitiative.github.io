<P>Printer drivers that support the new members in the <B>DEVMODE</B> structure must set DEVMODE.dmSpecVersion to 0x0400. If a driver sets DEVMODE.dmSpecVersion to this value, the driver must also meet the following requirements: 

<UL>
	<LI>The driver must always return 0x0400 to a <B>DeviceCapabilities</B> function call that uses a DC_VERSION argument. </LI>

	<LI>The driver must use the new <B>DEVMODE</B> structure definition, even if it does not use any of the new members (it should initialize them to zero). </LI>

	<LI>The driver must use <B>DrvSetPrinterData</B> to store printer driver settings and use <B>DrvGetPrinterData</B> to retrieve them. </LI>

	<LI>The driver must be able to handle friendly user-defined printer names, which can be any string up to 32 characters in length (including the terminating NULL character). When an application passes the driver a friendly printer name, the driver must query the registry to determine what the corresponding printer model name is. The driver can use the <B>DrvGetPrinterData</B> function to do this. </LI>

	<LI>If the <B>DEVMODE</B> data retrieved from the registry is incorrect, the driver must build a default <B>DEVMODE</B> and merge as many member values as possible, and then update the registry. Win32 applications can use the DEVMODE structure, so the driver must update DEVMODE.dmDeviceName with the current friendly printer name. </LI>

	<LI>Private <B>DEVMODE</B> data must contain the printer model name or some way of determining the current printer model name. </LI>

	<LI>The driver does not have to contain code that writes settings to INI files since these settings are now maintained on the registry. The driver may have to contain code that reads INI files. </LI>
</UL>

<P>In addition to the requirements listed above, there are two other more detailed requirements which are described below: 

<UL>
	<LI>The driver must handle brushes differently than in Windows 3.x. </LI>

	<LI>The driver must organize the private members of the DEVMODE structure into two groups: printer-sticky members and document-sticky members. </LI>
