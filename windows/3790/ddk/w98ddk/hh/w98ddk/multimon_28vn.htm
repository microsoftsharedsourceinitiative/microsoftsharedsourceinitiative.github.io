<P>Multimonitor support allows users to create large desktops in which the Windows desktop spans multiple monitors, thereby creating more onscreen real estate. The user can use a new control panel to configure the size and relative position of each monitor. Applications can be moved from one monitor to another, or they can be on more than one monitor simultaneously.</P>

<P>When the desktop spans multiple monitors, the operating system keeps all related windows, dialog boxes, and menus together on the same monitor  A window is maximized only to a single monitor. Pop-up menus never span across monitors. Dialog boxes are placed on the monitor that contains the application owning that window. Application compatibility is nearly complete, so existing applications will work without modification. (Exceptions are described later in this section.)</P>
