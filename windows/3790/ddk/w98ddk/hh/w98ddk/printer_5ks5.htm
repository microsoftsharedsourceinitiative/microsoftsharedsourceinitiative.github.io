<P>The <B>icHeader.manufacturer</B> tag is of type icSignature (a four-byte identifier value according to the ICC specification). The 4 bytes contain ASCII values; they are typically the first 4 characters of name of the printer manufacturer and, most importantly, are unique from other company names and correspond to the name that is used/reported by the printer driver. (For a more detailed discussion of how profiles and drivers are paired at run time, see <I>Mapping Color Profiles to Printer Drivers</I>. Examples values for this tag are "EPSO" for Epson, "CANO" for Canon, "HP " for Hewlett-Packard, and so on. </P>

<P>The deviceMfgDescTag value is also read and placed in the registry under the ManufacturerTag key for clarity even though it serves no functional purpose there. </P>
