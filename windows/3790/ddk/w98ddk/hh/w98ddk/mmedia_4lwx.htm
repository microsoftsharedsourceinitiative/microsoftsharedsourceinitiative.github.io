<P>Audio device drivers need to notify clients when certain events occur, such as when a waveform data block has been played or when a MIDI input event is received. When the client opens a device, the client specifies how it wants to be notified. There are three ways a driver can notify a client application: 

<UL>
	<LI>By calling a client-specified callback function </LI>

	<LI>By sending a message to a client-specified window </LI>

	<LI>By unblocking a client-specified task </LI>
</UL>

<P>To make the job of notifying clients easier, MMSYSTEM provides the <B>DriverCallback</B> function. <B>DriverCallback</B> takes information supplied by the client when it opened a device and notifies the client accordingly. </P>

<P>Clients must be notified when the following conditions occur: 

<UL>
	<LI>When a device is opened. </LI>

	<LI>When a device is closed. </LI>

	<LI>When the driver is finished with a data block. </LI>

	<LI>When the driver receives data that should be passed directly back to the application, such as when a MIDI input driver receives a MIDI event from an input port. </LI>
</UL>
