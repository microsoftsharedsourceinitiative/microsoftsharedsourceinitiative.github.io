<P>Raises or lowers the execution priority of the specified thread. The service adds the specified boost to the thread's current execution priority. Uses Flags. 

<UL>
	<LI>No return value. </LI>

<DL>
<DT><I>PriorityBoost</I></DT>

<DD>A signed integer value representing the positive or negative priority boost for the thread. This parameter must be a value such that when added to the current execution priority, the result is within the range Reserved_Low_Boost to Reserved_High_Boost. The following lists some common priority boost values, from lowest to highest:

<TD width=30%>Cur_Run_VM_Boost </TD>
<TD width=70%>Use to boost the priority of each thread, in turn, forcing them to run for their allotted timeslices. </TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=30%>Low_Pri_Device_Boost </TD>
<TD width=70%>Use for operations that need timely processing but are not time critical. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=30%>High_Pri_Device_Boost </TD>
<TD width=70%>Use for time-critical operations that should not circumvent the critical section boost. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=30%>Critical_Section_Boost </TD>
<TD width=70%>Use to boost the priority of the thread whenever it enters a critical section (calls <B>Begin_Critical_Section)</B>. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=30%>Time_Critical_Boost </TD>
<TD width=70%>Use for operations that require immediate processing, even when another thread is in a critical section. For example, VPICD uses this when simulating hardware interrupts. </TD>

<TD width=30%>Reserved_High_Boost </TD>
<TD width=70%>Reserved for use by system. </TD>

<P>Because the nonsuspended thread with the highest execution priority is always the current thread, this service causes a task switch under two circumstances: 

<UL>
	<LI>The execution priority of the current thread is lowered (EAX is negative), and there is another thread with a higher priority that is not suspended. </LI>

	<LI>The execution priority of a nonsuspended thread which is not the current thread is raised (EAX is positive) higher than the current thread's execution priority. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Even if the current thread is in a critical section, a task switch will still occur if the priority of another nonsuspended thread is raised higher than the current thread's priority. However, this will only occur when a thread is given a time-critical boost, for example, to simulate a hardware interrupt. </P>

<P>It is often more convenient to call the <B>Call_Priority_VM_Event</B> service than to call this service directly. </P>
