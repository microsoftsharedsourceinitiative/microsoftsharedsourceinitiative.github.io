<P>Your monitor or print processor DLLs can be installed using statements in the INF file Windows 95 uses to install your printer driver. Printer extension statements for INF files are defined for Windows 95 and this section describes how these printer extension statements are used and provides reference material for each statement. This section also describes how these INF file printer extensions statements are used in the context of Windows 95 device Plug and Play. </P>

<P>Under Windows 3.1x, Control Panel Printers program had some limitations on installing printer drivers. This caused some printer vendors to develop their own installation utilities to work around these limitations. </P>

<P>Under Windows 95, the mechanism for installing printer drivers is different, removing the Windows 3.1x limitations. A new user interface is also provided in Windows 95 that corrects the problems users have reported with the Windows 3.1x Control Panel Printers program. </P>

<P>In order to support the automatic Plug and Play printer installation described in the section Plug and Play Printer Installation and to support the manual printer installation method for non-Plug and Play printers that is described in this section, the printer INF file format for Windows 95 differs from the INF file format used with Windows 3.1x. This section defines the printer-specific changes to the INF file format and content. If you are developing a Windows 95 INF file for your printer installation, you must read tWindows 95 INF Files in addition to this section to get all the information you need to do the job. </P>

<P>Note that the OEMSETUP.INF file format for printer drivers from Windows 3.1x will continue to be supported in Windows 95 for backwards compatibility, but all printer vendors are strongly encouraged to use the new INF file format described here and in Windows 95 INF Files. </P>

<P>For Plug and Play printer installation and to use any of the new options for manual printer installation using the Add Printer icon, you will have to use the new INF file format and statements. </P>

<P>All of the printer-specific Windows 95 INF file extensions are individual lines that can be added to the simple text INF file. Each line has the form <I>key=value</I>. There are just over a dozen printer-specific keys that can be used and you only need to use a key to override the default. The following table lists the keys and defaults. </P>
