<P>The hardware passes pen information into the system by issuing a hardware interrupt. The handler routine in the virtual pen driver that services the interrupt is <B>cVpenD_Hw_Int</B>, which is in the sample driver source file HWINT.C. </P>

<P>The <B>cVpenD_Hw_Int</B> function calls the <B>cOEM_Hw_Int</B> function to gather the hardware-dependent information into a pen packet. (The <B>cOEM_Hw_Int</B> function is located in the sample driver source file OEMHWINT.C). The return codes from the <B>cOEM_Hw_Int</B> function indicate the status of the gathering process. A complete list of return codes implemented by the sample driver is in the following table. All return codes except FF_INCOMPLETE have either the FF_ERROR or FF_SUCCESS flag set. The other flags listed in the following table give more information about the type of error or type of success. </P>

<P>If the <B>cOEM_Hw_Int</B> function returns one of the codes that indicates success, then pen data has been gathered for the <B>cVpenD_HW_Int</B> function to process and send on to the pen driver. When the <B>cVpenD_Hw_Int</B> function has a complete pen packet, it orients the point coordinates to the proper display orientation (either landscape or portrait) and calibrates the (x,y) point, converting it to a resolution of 0.001 inch. </P>

<P>The <B>cVpenD_Hw_Int</B> function also adds extra hardware-independent information to the packet, such as a time stamp. The debugging version of the virtual pen driver also adds to the packet a sequential number stamp, profile information, and other hardware-independent data pertinent to debugging. The virtual pen driver then schedules a callback to its <B>cCall_Installable_Driver</B> function (located in the TIMERCB.C source file) so the pen packet will be sent to the pen driver. </P>

<P><B>cCall_Installable_Driver</B> determines the number of pen packets in the buffer waiting to be serviced and passes this number on to the pen driver along with the starting offset and index into the buffer. Finally, it calls the pen driver, which services the pen packet buffer. </P>

<P>When it receives control, the pen driver calls all its clients with the appropriate DT_ data type message. A complete list of DT_ data type messages is contained in the following table: </P>
