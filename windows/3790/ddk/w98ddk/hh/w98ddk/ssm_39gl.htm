<P>SSM has a variety of command-line options, which are designed to allow flexible and robust analysis of system resources and, optionally, to increase/decrease the granularity of the snapshots. Each option can be thought of as a filter to enable some of the features of SSM. </P>

<P>This section describes the command-line options that are used to detail some of the objects that you can use. </P>

<P><B>/T:&lt;Time interval between snapshots in minutes&gt; </B></P>

<P>Specifies the time, in minutes, to take snapshots in. This can be as low as one minute or as large as MAX_INT. The time interval you specify is the most difficult to determine. The rule of thumb is as follows: If resources are consumed very quickly when running, use a time interval that is small. If resources are consumed over a large period of time, use a time interval that is very large. The following table is a rough approximation of what you would typically want to use. </P>

<P>The granularity you use is configurable and any number you specify for T will be honored. </P>

<P>Setting a small time interval for a resource depletion that will occur over several days could generate log files megabytes in size. This is not recommended. Likewise, specifying a time interval very large for resource leaks on the order of an hour or two, will not prove to be useful either. Take extreme care when specifying the interval. </P>

<P><B>/A (This is preliminary and not completely implemented)</B> </P>

<P>Analyze logs and predict offenders and report lost resources. The /A parameter will take either the /EXPC parameter or the /MTTF parameter as companion arguments. When either of these are supplied, we will automatically assume that either a EZPC or MTTF log file will be present and that data in those logs is consistent with those tests. When neither of these are present, we assume the presence of a log created with /A and will analyze accordingly. </P>
