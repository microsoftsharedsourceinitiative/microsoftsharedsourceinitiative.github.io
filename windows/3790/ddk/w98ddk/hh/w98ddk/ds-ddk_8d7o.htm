<P>This document implies that the DirectSound driver performs floating point operations in ring 0 of the CPU. Executing floating point operations in a VxD brings up several issues. 

<UL>
	<LI>The original release of Windows 95 did not support execution of floating point operations in ring 0. When DirectX® 3 or later installs, it updates a part of Windows 95 to allow such operations. Drivers must not execute any floating point operations on Windows 95 unless DirectX 3 or later has been installed. </LI>

	<LI>Execution of the floating point instructions must occur only within the <B>IDsDriverPropertySet</B> calls received by the driver from DirectSound. Drivers cannot execute floating point operations within an interrupt service routine (ISR) or virtual machine manager (VMM) event handler. </LI>

	<LI>A floating point coprocessor must be installed in the system. The floating point emulator does not work at this level. </LI>

	<LI>VxDs cannot link to a C run-time library. Therefore, the VxD author must use floating point sparingly in the C source code and/or must write floating point code in assembly language without relying on a C runtime library. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The DirectSound team realizes that these limitations may be serious hurdles for some driver developers. Depending on the level of interest in this specification the DirectSound team may either a) provide direct developer-to-developer support to overcome these issues, or b) provide a simple solution appropriate for all driver developers (that is, a minimal library providing some basic C run time floating point functions that a VxD can link). </P>
