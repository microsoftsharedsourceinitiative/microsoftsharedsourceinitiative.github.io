<P>To ensure orderly resource allocation, only a subset of the possible state transitions are allowed. The following table lists the allowed transitions along with tasks that the driver will typically perform.</P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=21%>Transition</TH>
<TH align=left width=79%>Description</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>Stop to Pause</TD>
<TD width=79%>Allocate resources. The read SRBs are typically queued after the transition to the Pause state has completed.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>Pause to Run</TD>
<TD width=79%>Begin streaming.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>Run to Pause</TD>
<TD width=79%>Stop streaming. The outstanding read SRBs remain in the queue.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>Pause to Stop</TD>
<TD width=79%>Deallocate resources and complete all outstanding read SRBs. SRBs that have not been filled with an image are completed with zero length in the KSSTREAM_HEADER.DataUsed field.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>Note that the transitions may cycle multiple times between the Pause and Run state before returning to the Stop state. Drivers should expect transitions such as:</P>

<P class=indent1>stop -&gt; pause -&gt; run -&gt; pause -&gt; run -&gt; pause -&gt; stop.</P>

<P>When a stream is in the Stopped state, it must immediately complete all outstanding data-read SRBs.</P>

<P>Since a user mode application can terminate unexpectedly while streaming, all capture drivers must accept an SRB_CLOSE_STREAM at any time. Under these conditions, all outstanding buffers are canceled by the stream class through the cancel routine immediately before the SRB_CLOSE_STREAM is received. Note however, that the Stream state may not be set to the stopped state prior to the termination.</P>
