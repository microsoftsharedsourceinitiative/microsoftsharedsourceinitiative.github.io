<P>The <B>TdiuReceive</B> function is called through the <B>TdiReceiveEntry</B> pointer in the <B>TdiDispatchTable</B> structure. </P>

<P>This request receives data on a connected connection. If no data is currently available on the connection the request will pend until there is data. A receive request may specify whether normal data, urgent data, or either may be placed in the given buffer. The connection on which a receive is issued must be connected and must not have received a FIN. </P>

<H4>Parameters</H4>

<DL>
<DT><I>Flags</I></DT>

<DD>Used both to specify the type of data which may be placed in the buffer and to return the type of data actually placed in the buffer. On input, <I>Flags</I> may be zero, TDI_RECEIVE_NORMAL, TDI_RECEIVE_EXPEDITED, or (TDI_RECEIVE_NORMAL | TDI_RECEIVE_EXPEDITED). If <I>Flags</I> is zero, MSTCP will interpret it as TDI_RECEIVE_NORMAL. <I>Flags</I> must not be set to NULL.

<P>If <I>Flags</I> is set to TDI_RECEIVE_EXPEDITED, only urgent data will be placed in the buffer. When the request completes successfully, <I>Flags</I> will be set to either TDI_RECEIVE_NORMAL or TDI_RECEIVE_URGENT. Also, the TDI_RECEIVE_ENTIRE_MESSAGE bit is set in <I>Flags</I> on completion. The transport will not combine urgent and normal data into one buffer chain. See the Windows NT/Windows 2000 TDI documentation for more details on the flags. 
</DD>

<DT><I>RcvLength</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the total length in bytes of data that may be placed in the buffer chain pointed to by <I>Buffer</I>. This length may be less than the sum of the sizes of the individual buffers in the chain, but it may not be greater than this sum. If the <I>RcvLength</I> is smaller than the actual size of the buffer chain, only <I>RcvLength</I> bytes will be placed in the buffer.

<P>For example, if <I>Buffer</I> points to a chain of three 100-byte buffers but <I>RcvLength</I> is set to 100 on input, only the first buffer in the chain would be used. If the <B>TdiReceive</B> requests completes immediately with success, <I>RcvLength</I> will be set by the transport to the actual number of bytes received. If the request pends or fails, <I>RcvLength</I> is unused. Thus, <I>RcvLength</I> needs to be valid only for the duration of the actual call to <B>TdiReceive</B>, and not until the time the receive completes. If the receive request pends, the number of bytes received will be returned as the <I>ByteCount</I> parameter passed to the request completion callback routine.
</DD>

<DT><I>Buffer</I></DT>

<DD>Points to an <B>NDIS_BUFFER</B> chain into which data will be copied. The individual buffers in this chain must be locked before submitting them.
</DD>
