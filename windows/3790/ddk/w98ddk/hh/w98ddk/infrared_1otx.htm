<P>For scenarios that illustrate work and home use of IR communications with computers, see <I>Work Place and Business Trip Scenarios</I> and <I>Family and Home Scenarios</I>. All of the uses described in these scenarios will become possible. And Microsoft has plans to develop extensions to Windows for other wireless media in addition to IR. Can you imagine other scenarios, especially when other forms of wireless communication, like radio frequency (RF) or cellular data, are integrated with computers? </P>

<P>Here are some basic suggestions for getting started with the low-cost IR media that is available today: 

<UL>
	<LI>Purchase a couple IR-capable devices designed to be IrDA compliant. </LI>

	<LI>Start experimenting with the Microsoft IrDA-compliant Windows 95 IR Communications device driver. </LI>
</UL>
