<P>Initialization for some SCSI adapters can be time consuming. The SCSI miniport driver will be passed a flag indicating that real mode initialization has taken place. This must be honored by miniport drivers whose initialization sequence is identical to real mode initialization and is excessively time consuming. </P>

<P>The <B>RealModeInitialized</B> member, a BOOLEAN, in the port configuration information will be set if Windows 95 can determine that real mode adapter initialization has occurred. The value of this member should be saved away in the device extension for the miniport driver and be used by the HW_INITIALIZE and possibly other routines. </P>
