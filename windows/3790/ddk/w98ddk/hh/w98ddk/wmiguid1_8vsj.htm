<P>Any driver that receives and processes IRPs can be a WMI driver. Microsoft will modify some, but not all, of the class/port drivers that ship with Windows® 98 and Windows® 2000 to provide WMI support. These class/port drivers receive IRPs and have a private interface to their miniport drivers. The private interface will be extended to support WMI. </P>

<P>A driver that receives IRPs needs to meet the following requirements in order to provide WMI functionality:

<UL>
	<LI>The driver needs to register its device object with WMI.</LI>

	<LI>The driver needs to publish its schema to indicate the nature of the data the driver will provide.</LI>

	<LI>The driver needs to handle WMI IRP_MJ_SYSTEM_CONTROL IRPs.</LI>

	<LI>The driver needs to manage instance names for the data blocks it provides.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Notice that those device drivers that do not register with WMI to provide data still must forward the IRP_MJ_SYSTEM_CONTROL_IRPs to the next device in the device stack. The following topics describe these IRPs in detail. </P>
