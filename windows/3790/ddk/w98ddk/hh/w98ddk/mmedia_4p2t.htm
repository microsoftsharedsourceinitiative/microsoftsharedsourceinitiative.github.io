<P>An audio mixer driver must support this message. The Mixer Manager will validate the following parameters for the MXDM_GETCONTROLDETAILS message before calling the driver. Your driver does not need to check for the following conditions: 

<OL>
	<LI><I>dwParam1</I> contains a valid pointer to a <B>MIXERCONTROLDETAILS</B> structure. This structure will be at least large enough to hold the base <B>MIXERCONTROLDETAILS</B> structure members. This buffer has also been validated to insure it is big enough to hold at least <B>cbStruct</B> bytes of information. </LI>

	<LI>All members of the <B>MIXERCONTROLDETAILS</B> structure have been validated to contain proper structure sizes and a valid pointer to one or more mixer control details structures. </LI>

	<LI><I>dwParam2</I> will be a valid combination of flags. </LI>
</OL>

<P>A mixer driver should validate the control identifier and should verify that the size of the details buffer for a custom mixer control is correct. </P>

<P>A mixer driver should verify that the <B>cChannels</B> member of the <B>MIXERCONTROLDETAILS</B> structure is correct for the control. This member must be zero for custom mixer controls and nonzero for standard mixer controls. </P>

<P>If the calling application specifies <B>cChannels</B> equal to one for a multi-channel control, the driver must combine the channel values into one value using the following rules: </P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=40%>MIXERCONTROL_CT_CLASS_CUSTOM </TD>
<TD width=60%>This class of mixer controls cannot be coalesced; <B>cChannels</B> must always be zero. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=40%>MIXERCONTROL_CT_CLASS_FADER </TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=40%>MIXERCONTROL_CT_CLASS_LIST </TD>
<TD width=60%>This class of mixer controls should logically or all values of all channels as the return value. For single selection lists, the left channel information should be returned. </TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=40%>MIXERCONTROL_CT_CLASS_TIME </TD>
<TD width=60%>This class of mixer controls should use the largest absolute value of all channels as the return value. </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>A mixer driver should verify that the <B>cMultipleItems</B> member of the <B>MIXERCONTROLDETAILS</B> structure is correct for the control. It is invalid to specify any number for <B>cMultipleItems</B> other than the value given in the <B>cMultipleItems</B> member of the <B>MIXERCONTROL</B> structure. </P>

<P>An application can generate two types of queries for a mixer control's details. A driver must use the bitwise AND operator with <I>dwParam2</I> and the MIXER_GETCONTROLDETAILSF_QUERYMASK constant to obtain the query type. 

<UL>
	<LI>If the result matches the MIXER_GETCONTROLDETAILSF_VALUE constant, the query is a request for the control's current value. </LI>

	<LI>If the result matches the MIXER_GETCONTROLDETAILSF_LISTTEXT constant, the request is to get the list text and instance data for list or banded controls. </LI>
</UL>

<P>All mixer drivers must support these queries. If a query other than the above list is sent that the mixer device does not know how to handle, MMSYSERR_NOTSUPPORTED must be returned. </P>
