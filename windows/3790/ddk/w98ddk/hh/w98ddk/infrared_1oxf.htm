<TD width=33%>OEMDONGL.C </TD>
<TD width=33%>Contains the OEMDongleTable which is an array of <B>DONGLE_TYPE</B> structures that list the supported dongles and their support functions. 
<P>Contains the OEMDongleTableLen variable that specifies the number of dongles that support is being added for. </P>

<P>Contains the functions to support initializing the dongle, setting the dongle's speed (from 2400 baud to 115,200 baud), and turning off the dongle. </P>
</TD>
<TD width=34%>The functions currently in OEMDONGL.C are for the ACTiSYS 200L dongle, except the content of the OEMDongleTable array and the names of the <B>type_Init</B>, <B>type_SetSpeed</B>, and <B>type_Deinit</B> functions have been changed to highlight the parts of the code you must change. Note that the name of the OEMDongleTable array and the OEMDongleTableLen variable must not be changed. More details about this are given in the following. </TD>

<TD width=33%>CVXDCTRL.ASM </TD>
<TD width=33%>Wrapper that can be linked with OEMDONGL.C to produce a dynamically loadable VxD. </TD>
<TD width=34%>The sample CVXDCTRL.ASM source code is for the ACTiSYS 200L dongle. You will have to edit this code to establish the name of your VxD. </TD>
