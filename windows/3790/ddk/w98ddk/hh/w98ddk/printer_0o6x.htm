<UL>
	<LI>Include files PRINT.H and GDIDEFS.INC, which are on the path %DDKROOT%\INC16 after the Windows 95 DDK is installed. The system INCLUDE environment variable must identify the directory that contain these files; this can be done by running DDKENV.BAT with the appropriate parameters after the DDK is installed. </LI>

	<LI>Include files MDEVICE.H, MINDRVRC.H, MINIDRIV.H, PFM.H, and UNIDRV.H, which are on the path %DDKROOT%\PRINTER\INC after the Windows 95 DDK is installed. The system INCLUDE environment variable must identify the directory that contains these files; this can be done by running the DDKENV.BAT file with the appropriate parameters. </LI>

	<LI>The UniTool application (UNITOOL.EXE) and the UniTool help file (UNITOOL.HLP), which are on the path %DDKROOT%\PRINTER\BIN after the Windows 95 DDK is installed. </LI>

	<LI>The UniTool setup information file (UNITOOL.INF), which is in %WINROOT% after the DDK is installed. </LI>

	<LI>The Unitool configuration settings file (UNITOOL.INI), which is in %WINROOT% after the DDK is installed. </LI>

	<LI>The minidriver source file (MINIDRIV.C), which is in %DDKROOT%\PRINTER\SAMPLES after the DDK is installed. </LI>

	<LI>LIBINIT.ASM, which is in %DDKROOT%\PRINTER\SAMPLES after the DDK is installed. </LI>

	<LI>The Windows 95 DDK environment batch file (DDKENV.BAT) which is in the directory %DDKROOT% after the Windows 95 DDK is installed. You can run this batch file with the parameters <I>16</I> and <I>printer</I> to establish the LIB and INCLUDE environment variable values you need to run UNITOOL.EXE. </LI>
