<P>The Windows® 95 Device Manager is the central component of device installation and configuration. A set of default device installers and Control Panel programs, which work with Device Manager, are supplied with Windows 95. There are several development requirements and opportunities for customizing the installation and configuration of your device. Device developers have the option of creating an installer, creating a Control Panel program, or extending a default Control Panel program. Device developers must create a device information (INF) file for their device. </P>

<P>This section describes the tools and interfaces you can use to customize the installation and configuration of your device. </P>
