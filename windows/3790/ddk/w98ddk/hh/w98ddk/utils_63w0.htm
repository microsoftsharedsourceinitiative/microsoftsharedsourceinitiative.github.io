<P>The <B>m</B> command moves a block of memory from one memory location to another. If part of the destination block overlaps some of the source block, the move is always performed without loss of data. Addresses that could be overwritten are moved first. 

<DL>
<DT><I>range</I> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the block of memory to be moved. </DD>

<DT><I>addr</I> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the starting address at which the memory is to be relocated. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>For moves from higher to lower addresses, the sequence of events is first to move the data at the block's lowest address and then to work toward the highest. For moves from lower to higher addresses, the sequence is first to move the data at the block's highest address and then to work toward the lowest. </P>

<P>The following example first moves the data at address CS:110 to CS:510 and then moves the data at CS:10F to CS:50F, and so on, until the data at CS:100 is moved to CS:500: </P>
