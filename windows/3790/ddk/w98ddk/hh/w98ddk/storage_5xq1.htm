<P>This service maps a long name format case-preserved Unicode name into an uppercased "basis" name which is also in Unicode but in the FCB-format, that is, it has a "primary" name with 8 characters and a 3-character "extension" immediately following it with no intervening dot character. For this service, the source and destination buffers must be different. </P>

<P>The following rules are used to create the basis name: 

<OL>
	<LI>Leading dots and trailing dots are ignored in generating the basis name. </LI>

	<LI>Embedded whitespace characters are ignored in generating the basis name. </LI>

	<LI>The first three nonwhitespace characters after the last embedded dot in the name form the 'extension'. </LI>

	<LI>The first 8 characters of the name form the 'primary' name. If there are dot characters before the first 8 characters (excluding leading dots), then the 'primary' name is that part of the name until the first dot character is hit. </LI>

	<LI>The long name syntax allows for certain special characters which are not allowed in the old DOS syntax. These characters are all replaced by an "_" character. In addition, any Unicode character which is part of the newly formed basis name but is not translatable in the current OEM codepage is replaced by an "_" character. </LI>
</OL>

<DL>
<DT><I>pBasisName</I> </DT>

<DD>Supplies a flat pointer to the buffer the basis name is to be returned in. This buffer must be at least 22 bytes long. </DD>

<DT><I>pUniName</I> </DT>

<DD>Supplies a flat pointer to the Unicode name from which the basis name needs to be generated. </DD>

<DT><I>length</I> </DT>

<DD>Supplies the length in bytes of the Unicode input name. </DD>
</DL>

<UL>
	<LI>Returns the state of the mapping operation. These flags can be used to determine what information has been lost as a result of the mapping. </LI>
