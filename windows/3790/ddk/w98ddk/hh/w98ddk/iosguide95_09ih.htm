<H2><A NAME="ddk_unraveling_the_scatter_gather_descriptor_confusion_si"></A>Unraveling the Scatter-Gather Descriptor Confusion</H2>

<P>There are two different types of Scatter Gather Descriptors: <I>linear</I> (also known as <I>logical</I>) and <I>physical</I>.</P>

<P>Walt Oney's book, <I>Systems Programming for Windows 95</I>, includes some discussion of this issue.</P>

<H4>Linear SGDs</H4>

<P>The linear SGD structure is defined in \ddk\inc32\blockdev.h (as _BlockDev_Scatter_Gather):</P>

<PRE>typedef struct BlockDev_Scatter_Gather{
  ULONG BD_SG_Count;
  ULONG BD_SG_Buffer_Ptr;
}  _BlockDev_Scatter_Gather     ;</PRE>

<P>A linear SGD consists of a DWORD count followed by a DWORD linear pointer. The count is always assumed to be a block count within SCSIPORT's transfer routines (such as ScsiPortReadPortBufferUchar). Linear SGDs are terminated with a zero-length SGD element, but you should use IOR_xfer_count for total length information (this field contains the sector count if IORF_CHAR_COMMAND is not set). The IOP's IOR_buffer_ptr points to a normal linear memory buffer if (IOR_flags &amp; IORF_SCATTER_GATHER)==FALSE. Otherwise, IOR_buffer_ptr points to a simple list of linear SGDs as defined in blockdev.h.</P>

<H4>Physical SGDs</H4>

<P>The physical SGD structure is defined in \ddk\inc32\sgd.h (as _SGD):</P>

<PRE>typedef struct _SGD { /* */
  ULONG  SG_buff_ptr;     /* 32-bit physical pointer to the buffer
  ULONG  SG_buff_size;    /* size of the buffer in bytes
} SGD, *PSGD;</PRE>

<P>The physical SGD structure consists of a DWORD physical pointer followed by a DWORD count (the ordering is the reverse of that used in the linear SGD structure). If the port driver demanded the physical SGD creation service, then the DCB_dmd_phys_sgd bit will be set within DCB_dmd_flags. </P>

<P>Inside SCSIPORT.PDR, the  ILB_int_io_criteria_rtn is called before forwarding any read/write to the miniport driver. ILB_int_io_criteria_rtn will create physical SGDs if DCB_dmd_phys_sgd is set. In this case, the IOP's IOR_sgd_lin_phys field must point to a valid memory buffer, designed to accommodate the max number of physical SGDs (DCB_max_sg_elements). Each SGD is eight bytes long. It would be safe to assign (17*8) bytes of memory for IOR_sgd_lin_phys since the maximum number of SGDs is 17.</P>
