<P>Windows Me provides a fixed number of worker threads.</P>

<P>The fixed number of worker threads provided by Windows Me is not necessarily enough to satisfy the demands of drivers using functions such as ExQueueWorkItem and IoQueueWorkItem, giving rise to the likelihood of deadlocks especially during power operations. To minimize the deadlock risk, you can create your own dedicated threads to handle power operations or avoid queuing work items in situations that are known to cause deadlocks.</P>
