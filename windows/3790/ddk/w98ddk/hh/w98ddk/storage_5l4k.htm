<P>A remote FSD accesses a remote file server through a network connection. The FSD translates the IFS requests into a network specific protocol and transfers them across a network to a file server. A remote FSD is often referred to as a network redirector. The linkage between a logical drive and a network resource is established through a connection operation. The connection operation provides the redirector with a network resource name that the connection is being made to. If the name is valid for the redirector, it may create its own structures required to manage the network connection. Network redirectors register with the IFS manager using the IFSMgr_RegisterNet service and get called on the FS_ConnectResource entry point to establish a connection with a resource. Once connected, all requests are routed through the interface established as a result of the connect operation. </P>
