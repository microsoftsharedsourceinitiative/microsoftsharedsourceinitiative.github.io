<P>If the documentation for this release of the Windows® 95 DDK states that the WHQL tests and tools are included in the DDK, that is not the case. Download the compatibility tests, test documentation, and test tools from one of the Internet sites. That way, you know you are always getting the most recent versions. </P>

<P>If the DDK documentation states that you must run a Setup program called Ctsetup.exe from the \Ct directory of the DDK to install the compatibility tests and tools, that is not the case. Ctsetup.exe is not included in this version of the DDK. When you download the compatibility tests for a device class from one of the Internet sites, a device class-specific Setup program is downloaded along with the tests, test instructions, and tools. Run that Setup program to install the tests and tools for your device class. </P>

<P>If the DDK documentation states that Ct setup instructions are on the DDK, that is not the case. </P>
