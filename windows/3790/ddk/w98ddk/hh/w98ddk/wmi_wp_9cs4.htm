<P>Microsoft will ship core WMI support in the operating system kernel and in a WMI driver for Windows®&nbsp;98 and for Windows® 2000. These kernel and driver pieces will support WMI services for the benefit of other drivers. Microsoft will also instrument the bus, port, and class drivers, as well as other drivers shipping with Windows&nbsp;2000, and will instrument the NDIS class driver shipping with Windows&nbsp;98. </P>

<P>This instrumentation will allow these components to provide instrumentation data and will create a mapping mechanism for the class or port driver, if needed. The NDIS class driver uses a similar mapping mechanism to map I/O request packets (IRPs) to object identifiers (OIDs), and the SCSI port driver uses a mapping mechanism to map IRPs to stream request blocks (SRBs). </P>

<P>Microsoft’s goal is to allow miniport driver writers to work with a familiar model]. For example, NDIS miniport driver writers can continue to work with OIDs, and SCSI miniport driver writers can continue to work with SRBs. The port/class driver maps these models to WMI as required. </P>

<P>Microsoft is also providing a WMI driver that maps Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) data on Windows&nbsp;2000. In addition, Windows&nbsp;2000 will include a driver that exports SMBIOS 2.1 tables into WBEM in Windows&nbsp;2000.</P>
