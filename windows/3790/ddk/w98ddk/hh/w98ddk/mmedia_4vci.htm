<P>The DVM_FRAME message lets an application obtain a single frame from the frame buffer.This message is the basis for the simplest form of video capture. Applications might use this to record animated sequences created frame-by-frame or to capture a single still image such as a photograph. </P>

<P class=proch><B><IMG SRC="../images/wedge.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>The following sequence of operations occurs when a client-application requests the transfer of a single video frame</B>

<OL>
	<LI>The client allocates the memory for the data buffer. </LI>

	<LI>The client sets a pointer to the empty data buffer in the VIDEOHDR data structure. </LI>

	<LI>The client sends the device driver a pointer to the VIDEOHDR data structure with the <B>videoFrame</B> function. (The destination channel must be a VIDEO_IN channel.) </LI>

	<LI>When the device driver receives the DVM_FRAME messages that Windows sends in response to <B>videoFrame</B>, it fills the data buffer with information from the frame buffer and updates the VIDEOHDR data structure. Note that the buffer might not have been prepared. </LI>

	<LI>When the device driver has filled a data buffer, it returns from the DVM_FRAME message. This returns control back to the client. </LI>

	<LI>After the client has finished with the data, it frees the memory used for the data. </LI>
</OL>
