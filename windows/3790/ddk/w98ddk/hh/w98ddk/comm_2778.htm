<P>A communications resource is a physical or logical device that provides a single asynchronous data stream. Serial ports, parallel ports, FAX machines, and modems are examples of communications resources. The central communications component in Windows 95 is the virtual communications driver (VCOMM), a virtual device (VxD) that manages all access to communications resources. </P>

<P>VCOMM relies on separate VxDs, called port drivers, to access communications resources. This design makes VCOMM easily extensible. To support a nonstandard communications port, you can create a port driver. You may also need to create a port-virtualization VxD to virtualize the port for MS-DOS® – based applications. Under no circumstances should you replace VCOMM itself. Nor should you replace COMM.DRV, as was often necessary with previous versions of Microsoft® Windows™. </P>

<P>The following table briefly describes each component.</P>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=18%>VCOMM.386 </TD>
<TD width=82%>The virtual communications driver. VCOMM is a nonreplaceable system component that manages all access to communications resources. For more information, see <I>About VCOMM</I>. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=18%>COMM.DRV </TD>
<TD width=82%>The Windows communications driver. COMM.DRV provides a set of exported functions that USER.EXE calls to implement the Windows communications API. 
<P>COMM.DRV uses the VCOMM protected-mode API, and is therefore not tied to any specific communications hardware. Hardware vendors should not replace COMM.DRV, as was done in previous versions of Windows, but should create a port driver instead. </P>
</TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=18%>Client VxDs </TD>
<TD width=82%>Any VxDs that use the VCOMM client VxD services to access communications resources. Port-virtualization VxDs can be VCOMM client VxDs. Certain applications might install VCOMM client VxDs, bypassing the Windows communications API. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=18%>Port drivers </TD>
<TD width=82%>Installable VxDs that VCOMM uses to access communications devices. Hardware vendors create port drivers to enable Windows applications and VxDs to use their communications ports. For more information, see <I>About Communications Port Drivers</I>. </TD>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=18%>Port-virtualization VxDs </TD>
<TD width=82%>Installable VxDs that virtualize communications hardware for applications running in nonsystem virtual machines (VMs). Communications hardware vendors can create port-virtualization VxDs to virtualize their devices for MS-DOS applications. </TD>
