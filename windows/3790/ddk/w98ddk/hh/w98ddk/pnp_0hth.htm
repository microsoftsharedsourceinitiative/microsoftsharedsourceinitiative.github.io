<P>Configuration Manager will load the device loader for the card based on information in the registry. The device loader may be a Plug and Play device loader, or, to support Card Services clients, the PCMCIA bus enumerator may be the device loader. If the PCMCIA bus enumerator is the device loader, the driver will be a Card Services client, the device node will be handled specially, and a default device driver will be registered for the card by the device loader. </P>

<P>Configuration Manager calls the CONFIG_FILTER function in the adapter driver where it filters the PC card configurations so that they can be mapped by the adapter for the socket. Any logical configurations that cannot be supported by the adapter will be removed from the filtered logical configuration list. </P>

<P>Finally, when the configuration has been determined by Configuration Manager, the CONFIG_START function will be called and the PCMCIA bus enumerator will map the IRQ, I/O, and memory windows for the PC card by calling the Card Services module. Card Services configures the adapter to support the defined configuration and sets the configuration index in the cards registers. </P>
