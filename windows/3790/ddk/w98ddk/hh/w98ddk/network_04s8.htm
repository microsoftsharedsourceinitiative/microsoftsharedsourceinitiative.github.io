<P>There are two ways to initiate connecting to a network resource while browsing: 

<UL>
	<LI>For a network resource that is connectable, there is a connect verb in the network resource's context pane. The user can select the connect verb. </LI>

	<LI>The user can try to expand a network resource that requires a connection to the network in order to browse the objects that it contains. Browsing in this context will typically be files and directories. </LI>
</UL>

<P>There are three methods for attempting a connection: 

<UL>
	<LI>If demanded by the NP, the Shell can bring up an NP provided dialog. This takes precedence over any other method. </LI>

	<LI>The connection is attempted with the minimum necessary interaction with the user by using default values. To change or see these values, the user does so through the connection's properties pages. This connection method occurs, if possible, when the user attempts to expand a network resource. The default values are targeted at the browsing user, and hence are: use any cached authentication information, not make the connection persistent, and not associate a local DOS device. </LI>

	<LI>The connection is attempted where the user is given full control of the values. This method is attempted when the user selects the connect verb. If authentication is required, any cached authentication information is taken, but the user is given the opportunity to change his authentication information. The user is given the option of selecting a local DOS device to associate with the connection, as well as the option to select whether or not the connection is persistent. </LI>
</UL>
