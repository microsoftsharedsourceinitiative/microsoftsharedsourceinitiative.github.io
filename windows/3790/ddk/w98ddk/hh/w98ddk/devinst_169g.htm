<P>In this case some logical devices may not be always physically present on the parent board at all time. The recommended Plug and Play solution is to tie the device information and configuration logic to the presence of the daughter card. This will enable Windows 95 to correctly enumerate and configure the devices when they are present. If this is not possible, another alternative is to always report all the possible logical devices. Windows 95 will install all these devices and configure them. This will require the board vendor to provide device drivers and INF files for all the possible devices. The drivers will be loaded by Windows 95 at boot time. If the driver(s) for the daughter card device(s) don't find their respective devices they can return DEVICE_NOT_THERE to the configuration manager. This will enable the configuration manager to re-use the resources the daughter card would ordinarily require. When the daughter card is plugged in, the drivers will initialize successfully and retain their assigned resources. If installing all the drivers is not possible, the user will be forced to select "don't use device" for each of the missing logical devices. In this case, when the daughter card is added to the system, the user will need to re-enable the daughter card's logical devices via the device manager. </P>

<P>See the next section for discussion on the case in which the driver for the parent card needs to be replaced when the daughter card is added. </P>
