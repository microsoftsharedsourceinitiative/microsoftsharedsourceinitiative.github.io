<P>This documentation provides an overview for writing Windows Driver Model (WDM) device drivers under Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;Edition (Windows&nbsp;Me). The information is useful to both new and experienced driver writers.</P>

<P>WDM defines a unified driver model for Windows&nbsp;98, Windows&nbsp;Me, and Windows&nbsp;2000 and later, that has standard requirements and thus reduces the amount of code that needs to be written. Programmers already familiar with Windows&nbsp;NT®&nbsp;4.0 drivers will recognize many of the features of WDM drivers. However, the documentation and samples should be studied in order to understand WDM requirements. WDM drivers will not run on operating systems earlier than Windows&nbsp;98 or Windows&nbsp;2000.</P>

<P>By conforming to WDM, drivers can be source-compatible across Windows&nbsp;98, Windows&nbsp;Me, and Windows&nbsp;2000 and later operating systems. However, subsequent operating system releases will contain features not available in preceding versions. WDM is designed to be forward compatible but not backward compatible. That is, drivers will be compatible with the same or higher numbered WDM versions. Older WDM drivers will not be able to take advantage of new operating system services but will still load and run. However, drivers written for a newer version of WDM will most likely fail during loading on a system that supports an older version. </P>

<P>WDM driver writers should carefully consider which features to include. For example, does the driver need to run on different platforms? Will the hardware be widely available or is it highly specialized and thus limited in distribution? Additionally, not all hardware meets the requirements of WDM. Video drivers do not support the WDM model and must be written separately, as do certain drivers utilizing VxDs under Windows&nbsp;98 and network drivers. Virtual hardware (emulation) and nonstandard buses are not supported in a WDM class.</P>

<P>A dual operating system driver must conform to the lowest WDM version on either operating system. For cross-operating system compatibility, thoroughly test drivers on all operating system versions you intend to support, because operating system differences can produce slightly different driver behavior. Differences are most apparent between single processor and multiprocessor platforms.</P>
