<P>This function is used by a driver to post a notification message. MCI devices use this function only when the MCI_NOTIFY flag is used with an MCI command message. 

<UL>
	<LI>Returns TRUE if a notification was successfully sent. </LI>

<DT><I>hCallback</I> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the handle of the window to notify. </DD>

<DT><I>uDeviceID</I> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the device ID which triggered the callback. </DD>

<DT><I>uStatus</I> </DT>

<DD>Specifies the status of the callback. Status values include: 

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>MCI_NOTIFY_ABORTED </TD>
<TD width=66%>Specifies that the device received a command that prevented the current conditions for initiating the callback from being met. If a new command interrupts the current command and it also requests notification, send this message and not MCI_NOTIFY_SUPERSEDED. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>MCI_NOTIFY_SUCCESSFUL </TD>
<TD width=66%>Specifies that the conditions initiating the callback have been met. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>MCI_NOTIFY_SUPERSEDED </TD>
<TD width=66%>Specifies that the device received another command with the MCI_NOTIFY flag set and the current conditions for initiating the callback have been superseded. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>MCI_NOTIFY_FAILURE </TD>
<TD width=66%>Specifies that a device error occurred while the device was executing the command. </TD>

<P>This function is callable at interrupt time. </P>

<P>A device sends MCI_NOTIFY_SUCCESSFUL when the action for a command finishes. For example, a CD audio device uses this flag for notification for MCI_PLAY when the device finishes playing. The MCI_PLAY command completes successfully only when it reaches the specified end position or reaches the end of the media. Similarly, MCI_SEEK and MCI_RECORD do not return MCI_NOTIFY_SUCCESSFUL until they reach the specified end position or reach the end of the media. </P>

<P>A device sends MCI_NOTIFY_ABORTED only when it receives a command that prevents it from meeting the notification conditions. For example, the command MCI_PLAY would not abort notification for a previous play command provided that the new command does not change the play direction or change the ending position for the play command with an active notify. The MCI_RECORD and MCI_SEEK commands behave similarly. </P>

<P>Do not send MCI_NOTIFY_ABORTED when MCI_PLAY or MCI_RECORD is paused with MCI_PAUSE. The MCI_RESUME command delays completion of MCI_PLAY and MCI_RECORD but does not cancel the commands. The MCI_RESUME command will let them continue to meet the callback conditions. </P>

<P>If a device cannot execute a command, set the error return for the message but do not send a notification message. </P>
