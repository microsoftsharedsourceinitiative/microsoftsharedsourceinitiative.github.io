<P>To write a miniVDD for Windows 98, you must have the most recent version of the Windows 98 DDK. Follow these recommendations for ensuring that you have up-to-date information for writing and testing display device drivers for Windows 98: 

<UL>
	<LI><B>Participate in Windows 98 display driver development</B>.
<P>If you are developing hardware for computers running Windows 95 or Windows 98, you should be developing drivers based on the support defined in the DirectX® Device Driver Kit (DDK). New features in Windows 98, such as multiple monitor support, OnNow power management, and refresh rate support, require driver modifications. To register, send e-mail to directx@microsoft.com with "DDK Request" in the subject line. Please include your name, title, company name, and phone and fax numbers, and provide a complete description of your hardware driver, including which device class it falls under.
</LI>

	<LI><B>Participate in Windows 98 beta testing</B>.
<P>To participate in beta testing for Windows 98, please send e-mail to memreq@microsoft.com. Please include your name, title, company name, company type (IHV, ISV, ISP, or OEM), and phone and fax numbers. 
</LI>

	<LI><B>Submit hardware to the Windows Platform Group for testing</B>.
<P>You must ensure that the Windows 98 product team has the appropriate hardware to test your driver, either by having Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) deliver the hardware to the Windows 98 product team at the completion of logo testing, or by providing compatible hardware directly to the Windows 98 product team. If you are not already working with a program manager in the Windows Platform Group, please send e-mail to nt5req@microsoft.com to submit hardware. Please include your name, title, company name, company type (IHV, ISV, ISP, or OEM), and phone and fax numbers.
</LI>

	<LI><B>Submit new drivers to WHQL for testing</B>.
<P>If you are developing new hardware or making changes that result in a new binary, be sure to submit your drivers, INF files, and hardware to WHQL for testing. For information, please send e-mail to whqlinfo@microsoft.com.
