<P>The DirectSound API provides a scaleable architecture. DirectSound features are implemented in software and are available on base-level cards (the installed base). However, if the hardware resources are available, DirectSound offloads processing onto the sound card. </P>

<P>For application developers, scaleability means they can take advantage of hardware acceleration in a device-independent manner. Applications can simply open and configure their audio buffers, and DirectSound performs the hardware-dependent task of allocating hardware resources to the various buffers. Applications are permitted to query DirectSound about the hardware resources of the sound card and the resources allocated to each buffer. This permits high-performance applications to scale to the hardware resources available. For example, an action game might use more sounds if it knows that hardware mixing is available. This allows the game to take full advantage of high-end cards while still performing well on low-end machines. </P>

<P>For sound card manufacturers, scaleability means that new sound cards can add immediate value to DirectSound applications. For example, hardware mixing offloads processing to the sound card, making games run faster and smoother. Hardware 3-D support can immediately improve the sound quality by using complex algorithms that are more realistic than the simple algorithms used in the DirectSound 3-D simulation code. Finally, any applications that scale to the hardware immediately start using more sounds and 3-D positioning. This helps sell more cards by providing an immediate advantage to the consumer. </P>

<P>The following sections outline the hardware features that can be exploited by DirectSound, both in the current implementation and in future implementations:
