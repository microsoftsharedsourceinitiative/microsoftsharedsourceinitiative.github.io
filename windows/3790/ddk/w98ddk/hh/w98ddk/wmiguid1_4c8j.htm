<P>The <B>IoWMIAllocateInstanceIds</B> routine allocates a range of instance IDs that are unique to the GUID. This routine is to be called only at PASSIVE_LEVEL.</P>

<P>Returns a status code.</P>

<P>If not using WMIREG_FLAG_PDO_INSTANCENAMES, great care should be taken in determining the instance names for a data block. This is because these names are used as part of the UI for management and performance monitoring applications. Instance names should be consistent with instance names of related data blocks and names used in other UI for configuring or viewing the device. Instance names should also be as descriptive as possible. </P>

<P>For example, if two joysticks are installed in a machine and each chose an instance name of “Joystick” you might end up with instance names of “Joystick1” and “Joystick2” (WMI automatically mangled the instance name suffix). A better approach would be for one joystick driver to register an instance name of “Sidewinder 3D Joystick” and the other “XYZ Joystick”. In the former case, it would be difficult for a management application to determine which joystick was the Sidewinder 3D.</P>

<P>The best approach for assigning static instance names is to use WMIREG_FLAG_PDO_INSTANCENAMES. This allows WMI to use the device instance ID of the PDO for the device as a base name. This approach promotes unique instance names and allows the caller to query a related GUID that will retrieve all the plug and play device information for the device, including a friendly name.</P>

<P>WMI provides the <B>IoWMISuggestInstanceName</B> function that can be used by a driver to help pick an appropriate instance base name. If specified, the function uses the physical device object (PDO) passed to obtain a friendly name or a device description name as the suggested instance name. Or if <I>SymbolicLinkName</I> is passed, the function uses it to obtain the friendly name for the device that was assigned that symbolic link name and uses that as the suggested instance name. If both are passed and <I>CombineNames</I> is TRUE, then the function will combine the names and return the combined name as the suggested instance name.</P>
