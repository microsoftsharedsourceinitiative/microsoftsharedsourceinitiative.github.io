<P>The Microsoft-provided local print provider <B>ReadPrinter</B> function either reads data from a bidirectional printer or reads data from a spool file. </P>

<TD width=24%><I>hPrinter</I> </TD>
<TD width=76%>Identifies an open printer associated with the print processor and must be obtained from a call to <B>OpenPrinter</B> before <B>ReadPrinter</B> is called. You must also call <B>StartDocPrinter</B> before the call to <B>ReadPrinter</B> and the setting of the <B>dwMode</B> member of the DOC_INFO_2 structure when the <B>StartDocPrinter</B> function call is made modifies the meaning of the subsequent <B>ReadPrinter</B> call. See the comments below for example code that illustrates how these function calls work together. If the <B>dwMode</B> member is set to DI_READ_SPOOL_JOB when the <B>StartDocPrinter</B> call is made, then the subsequent <B>ReadPrinter</B> call will read the spool file (which may contain either raw or EMF data). If <B>dwMode</B> is not set to DI_READ_SPOOL_JOB, then the subsequent <B>ReadPrinter</B> call will read status information from a bidirectional printer. </TD>

<P>The <B>ReadPrinter</B> function call is always preceded by a call to the <B>StartDocPrinter</B> call. If you set the <B>dwMode</B> member of the DOC_INFO_2 structure to DI_READ_SPOOL_JOB before making the <B>StartDocPrinter</B> function call, the subsequent <B>ReadPrinter</B> function call will read the spool file identified in the <B>pOutput</B> member of the DOC_INFO_2 structure instead of reading status information from the bidirectional printer your print processor is associated with. </P>

<P>The structure definition for the DOC_INFO_2 structure is shown below. </P>
