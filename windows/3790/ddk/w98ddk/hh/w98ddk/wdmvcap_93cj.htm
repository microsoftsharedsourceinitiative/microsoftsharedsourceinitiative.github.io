<P>Traditionally, DirectShow™ streams have been identified solely by their MediaTypes. While this is sufficient for rendering simple filter graphs, more complex graphs and graphs that reflect a hardware topology require additional information for correct graph building.</P>

<P>Kernel Streaming introduces two additional ways to identify and connect pins in a filter graph: Categories and Methods. The first way is to assign a pin to a Category, which is a GUID that identifies the primary purpose of the pin. For example, a capture filter could have two output pins with identical MediaTypes on each pin. If internally the filter gives priority to one of the pins, the higher priority pin could be assigned to the Capture category (PINNAME_VIDEO_CAPTURE), and the lower pin to the Preview category (PINNAME_VIDEO_PREVIEW). </P>

<P>The second way of identifying and connecting a pin is through the use of a Medium. A Medium is a unique identifier containing a GUID that is exposed on an output pin on one filter and an input pin on another filter. The Medium is used to ensure connectivity between these two pins. One way to think of a Medium is that it identifies a copper trace or wire between the output pin and the input pin.</P>

<P>The DirectShow graph builder interfaces <B>IFilterMapper2</B> and <B>ICaptureGraphBuilder</B> can be used to construct graphs based on both Mediums and Categories.</P>
