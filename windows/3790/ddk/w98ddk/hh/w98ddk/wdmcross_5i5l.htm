<H4>How to Add Peakmeters to the WDM Driver</H4>

<P>Peakmeters are nodes and have to be added to the driver topology. It is best to add the peakmeter node after the master out mute (or volume, whatever comes last). The same has to be done for the recording line and any additional lines if you want to have peakmeters there, too. The peakmeter node is “KSNODETYPE_PEAKMETER” and the property of this node is “KSPROPERTY_AUDIO_PEAKMETER”. Set the name of the node to “KSAUDFNAME_PEAKMETER”. </P>

<P>You will also need a property handler for this node. The property handler should support “KSPROPERTY_TYPE_GET”, “KSPROPERTY_TYPE_BASICSUPPORT” and the usual “KSPROPERTY_AUDIO_CPU_RESOURCES”. </P>

<P>The basic support handler is expected to return –32768 to 32767 for the data range, since this is the data range of 16 bit audio data. In the property handler for “get” you only have to read the HW peakmeter and return it. Be sure to check all parameters for vality before and also the channel information (left/right). </P>

<P>Unfortunately, there is no SW peakmeter available since the driver doesn’t know what signals are on “Line In”, “Microphone” or other inputs that are mixed with the playback channel. </P>
