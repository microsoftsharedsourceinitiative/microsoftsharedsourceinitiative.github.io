<P>Device information (INF) files provide the information that the Windows 95 operating system needs to install the software and information to support a given hardware device. Independent hardware vendors who develop Windows 95 device drivers must also create INF files to explicitly define the resources and files required to support each class of device. </P>

<P>Device information (INF) files provide the information that Windows 95 needs to install a given device and its associated software. IHVs who wish to install their devices and software using the Windows 95 built in installation support must create an INF to describe the device and its installation requirements. </P>

<P>Every INF is a collection of sections which describe a device, the resources required by that device and the installation procedure. Windows 95 New Device Wizard builds its list of installable devices by searching through the INFs. The Device Manager also displays information which originates in the INF. Every hardware INF follows the general organization described below. </P>

<P>If you have a Win 3.1-compatible driver which you are not planning to upgrade for plug and play, it is still a good idea to update the INF file so the system can inform the user of possible resource conflicts during installation. </P>
