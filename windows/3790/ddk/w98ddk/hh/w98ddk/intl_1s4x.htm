<P>The IME hot key is used to changed the IME input mode or to switch the IME. The IME hot key for switching directly to an IME is called the direct switching hot key. The identifier of a direct switching hot key is in the range IME_HOTKEY_DSWITCH_FIRST to IME_HOTKEY_DSWITCH_LAST. It is registered by an IME or control panel if the IME or a user wants such a hot key. The IME hot key is effective in all IMEs, no matter which IME is active. In Windows 95-FE, several predefined hot keys are defined by IMM. The IMM itself provides the functionality (different handling routines) of those hot key functions. Every hot key in Windows 95-FE has a different hot key identifier in IMM, and each identifier has it own functionality according to the requirements of each country/region. An application has no way to add another predefined hot key identifier to the system. </P>

<P>Following are the predefined hot key identifiers.</P>

<P>The other kind of hot key is the IME private hot key. There is no functionality for this kind of hot key. It is just a placeholder for a hot key value. An IME can get this value by using <B>ImmGetHotKey</B>. If an IME supports this functionality for one hot key identifier, the IME will perform the functionality every time it finds this key input. </P>

<P>Following are the current private IME hot key identifiers in Windows 95-FE.</P>
