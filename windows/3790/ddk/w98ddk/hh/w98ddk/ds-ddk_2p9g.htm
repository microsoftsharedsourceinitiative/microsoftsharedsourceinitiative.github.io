<P>A number of sound devices have recently included hardware support for compressed wave formats such as IMA ADPCM and G7.11. This is a useful feature only if one audio stream is playing at a time; if that stream is compressed, the hardware may be able to accelerate the decoding process. However, this feature is less useful when multiple streams are playing, since mixing must be performed on PCM streams. For this reason, DirectSound does not currently support compressed wave formats. However, support is planned for the future. </P>

<P>The first feature is support for compressed primary buffers. If an application obtains DSSCL_WRITEPRIMARY access and sets the primary buffer to a compressed format that is supported by the hardware, it succeeds and writes a compressed audio stream directly to the hardware. This is not useful for most applications, however, since only one stream can be played at a time.  </P>

<P>In a future release, DirectSound will provide complete support for compressed wave formats in secondary buffers. DirectSound will use hardware decompression if available and otherwise will decompress the formats in software using the Audio Compression Manager (ACM) APIs. </P>

<P>It should be mentioned that, given a choice between hardware-accelerated compression/decompression and hardware-accelerated 3-D positional audio, the 3-D support is much more desirable for high-volume applications such as games. </P>
