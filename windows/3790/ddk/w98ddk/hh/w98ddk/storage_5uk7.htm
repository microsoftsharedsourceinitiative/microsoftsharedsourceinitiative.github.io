<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>DISCONNECT_NO_IO </TD>
<TD width=66%>Disconnect the resource without doing any I/O operation. Pending I/O operations should be discarded. This will typically be called on volumes that have gone away, usually due to user action. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>DISCONNECT_SINGLE </TD>
<TD width=66%>Disconnect this resource alone. There are certain cases where multiple resources can be associated to one another and come and go as a unit. This flag is passed in to prevent all the resources from going away on associated resources. This is typically the case on compressed drives. </TD>

<P>The IFS  manager will ensure that all files on the resource have been closed before this call is made. The DISCONNECT_NO_IO case is the only situation in which this may not be true. If the DISCONNECT_NO_IO flag is passed in and the FSD has pending I/O operations on the volume it should return an error back on the disconnect operation so that the IFS manager can notify the user of this situation. Note that this function can be called at event time, FSDs should not make any assumptions about when this function is called. </P>
