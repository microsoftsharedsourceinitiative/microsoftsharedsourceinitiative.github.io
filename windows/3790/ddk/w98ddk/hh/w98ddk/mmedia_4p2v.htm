<DD>Specifies a pointer to a <B>MIXERLINECONTROLS</B> structure that references the <B>MIXERCONTROL</B> structures to receive the line controls information being requested. </DD>

<DT><I>dwParam2</I> </DT>

<DD>Specifies flags for getting the line controls information. This argument is identical to the <I>fdwControls</I> argument passed to the <B>mixerGetLineControls</B> function. For additional information about the flag settings, see the <B>mixerGetLineControls</B> function listed in the SDK documentation.

<P>An audio mixer driver must support this message. The Mixer Manager will validate the following parameters for the MXDM_GETLINECONTROLS message before calling the driver. Your driver does not need to check for the following conditions: 

<OL>
	<LI><I>dwParam1</I> will contain a valid pointer to a <B>MIXERLINECONTROLS</B> structure. This structure will be at least large enough to hold the base <B>MIXERLINECONTROLS</B> structure members. This buffer has also been validated to insure it is big enough to hold at least <B>cbStruct</B> bytes of information. </LI>

	<LI>All members of the <B>MIXERLINECONTROLS</B> structure have been validated to contain proper structure sizes and a valid pointer to one or more <B>MIXERCONTROL</B> structures. </LI>

	<LI><I>dwParam2</I> will be a valid combination of flags. </LI>
</OL>

<P>A mixer device driver must validate the <B>dwControlID</B>, <B>dwLineID</B> and <B>dwControlType</B> members of the <B>MIXERLINECONTROLS</B> structure if they apply to the query type being requested. The driver must also verify that the <B>cControls</B> member is valid for the MIXER_GETLINECONTROLSF_ALL query. The other two query types MIXER_GETLINECONTROLSF_ONEBYID and MIXER_GETLINECONTROLSF_ONEBYTYPE will cause the mixer manager to validate the <B>cControls</B> member to be one. </P>

<P>An application can generate three types of queries for a mixer line control. A driver must use the bitwise AND operator with <I>dwParam2</I> and the MIXER_GETLINECONTROLSF_QUERYMASK constant to obtain the query type. 

<UL>
	<LI>If the result matches the MIXER_GETLINECONTROLSF_ALL constant, the query is a request for all controls associated with the specified line (<I>dwLineID</I>). </LI>

	<LI>If the result matches the MIXER_GETLINECONTROLSF_ONEBYID constant, the request is to retrieve the control specified in <I>dwControlID</I>. </LI>

	<LI>If the result matches the MIXER_GETLINECONTROLSF_ONEBYTYPE constant, the query is a request for the first control on the specified line (<I>dwLineID</I>) that matches the type specified in <I>dwControlType</I>.. </LI>
</UL>

<P>All mixer drivers must support these queries. If a query other than those previously mentioned is sent, the mixer driver must return MMSYSERR_NOTSUPPORTED. </P>
