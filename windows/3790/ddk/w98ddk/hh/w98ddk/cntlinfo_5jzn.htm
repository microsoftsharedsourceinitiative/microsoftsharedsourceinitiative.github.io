<P>Each printer provides a unique set of commands that control the vertical and horizontal movement of the cursor (or print head) across the page. These commands are called cursor-movement commands. Some of these commands move the cursor with respect to the current position, or with respect to the page origin, and require information about the distance to be moved. Some of these commands move the cursor a fixed distance (these commands include the carriage return, linefeed, and formfeed). On some printers, the cursor-movement commands are somewhat primitive; for example, horizontal movement can only be achieved by sending a space character from a particular font. On other printers, a single command is available to move the cursor in both horizontal and vertical direction. The coordinate system used by cursor movement commands is based on the origin at the upper-left corner of the page. Positive movement is considered to be moving down the page (for y-movement commands), or moving to the right (for x-movement commands).</P>

<P>The CURSORMOVE dialog box contains controls in which you specify the cursor-movement commands and other related information which the Universal Printer Driver requires.</P>
