<P>MIDI output device drivers can process the MODM_DATA and MODM_LONGDATA messages either synchronously or asynchronously. If a driver processes these messages synchronously, it waits until all the data has been sent to the hardware before returning from the <B>modMessage</B> function. An asynchronous driver puts the data in a queue and returns immediately. The data is then sent to the hardware in the background. </P>

<P>Whether a driver is written to be synchronous or asynchronous usually depends on the hardware being supported. An asynchronous driver is desirable because it lets foreground applications run while it processes data; however, some hardware may not support asynchronous data transfer. The Sound Blaster sample driver processes the MODM_DATA and MODM_LONGDATA messages synchronously. </P>
