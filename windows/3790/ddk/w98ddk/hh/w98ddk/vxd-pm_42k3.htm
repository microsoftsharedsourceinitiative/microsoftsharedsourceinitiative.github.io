<P>This section describes the requirements and the implications for virtual device drivers (VxDs) in an OnNow power-managed system. Preliminary descriptions of the driver interfaces are presented. </P>

<P>The OnNow design initiative aims to make desktop computers more convenient to access and more energy-efficient by integrating fundamental power management capabilities with the users' environment. The OnNow architecture provides a fully integrated power management system. This system defines what is required so the various components of the computer work together to deliver consistent, intuitive, and effective power management to the user. </P>

<P>OnNow defines power management requirements for device and system hardware to implement power states and controls, for applications to participate in system power management, and for the operating system to direct power management and provide the necessary interfaces. The device driver is the key component where the hardware and software come together to produce energy savings and intuitive system behavior. </P>

<P>Microsoft designed support for OnNow power management in VxDs. It is the responsibility of driver writers to implement power management support in their VxDs.</P>

<P>In Windows® 98, the configuration manager provides services and sends messages that VxDs use to participate in the device and system power management schemes defined by the OnNow initiative.</P>

<P>VxDs listen for messages and call services in order to accomplish tasks such as supplying device capabilities for power management, switching a device to a low power state, and turning on a device.</P>

<P>A reference to all the configuration manager power management services and messages is also previewed in this section.</P>

<P class=note><B>Important</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The configuration manager services and messages documented in this section are still under development and any service or message described in this section may change.</P>
