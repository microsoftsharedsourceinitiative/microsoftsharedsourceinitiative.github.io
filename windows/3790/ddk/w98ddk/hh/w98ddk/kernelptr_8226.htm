<P>Kernel-mode drivers that conform to the Windows Driver Model (WDM) can run on Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, and Windows 2000 and later systems. All WDM drivers must use kernel-mode <I>driver support routines</I>, which are defined by the operating system. See the <I>Kernel-Mode Driver Reference</I> in the Windows DDK for information on these routines.</P>

<P>The <I>Kernel-Mode Driver Reference</I> documents all kernel-mode routines supported by Windows. Most of these routines are supported by WDM on Windows 98 and ME, but a few are not. The reference material for each support routine lists the header file(s) in which the routine is defined. Unless otherwise noted, routines defined in <I>wdm.h </I>can be used by WDM drivers on Windows 98, Windows ME, and Windows 2000 and later. Routines defined in <I>ntddk.h</I>, but not in <I>wdm.h</I>, are not supported on Windows 98 or ME.</P>

<P>In general, the support routines behave similarly on all three operating systems. Any individual differences are noted in the reference page for the relevant routine. </P>
