<P>The WDM stream class driver allows developers to create a compact minidriver that is hardware specific and lets the class driver handle the allocation of system resources and memory. The stream class driver can handle both video and audio streaming. The WDM DDK includes sample minidrivers as well as documents that explain how to implement a minidriver using the WDM stream class driver. For more information on the WDM stream class driver, see the Stream Class Driver Reference</P>

<P>USBCAMD is a helper driver to “stream” class minidrivers for USB digital cameras. The camera’s stream class minidriver, referred to as the cam minidriver, contains the device (hardware) specific code. USBCAMD provides generic services that manage isochronous data streams on the USB. USBCAMD also manages some of the tedious USB configuration process of the camera for the cam minidriver. USBCAMD allows the minidriver writer to focus on support for camera properties and image processing instead of the details of maintaining an ISO stream on the USB.</P>
