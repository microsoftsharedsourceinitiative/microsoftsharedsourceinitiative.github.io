<P>Notifies a virtual device that the system is creating a new thread. Virtual devices typically create and initialize any structures needed to support the new thread. The virtual device may use all general registers and flags. 

<UL>
	<LI>The virtual device returns with carry clear to allow the thread to be created, or with carry set to prevent it from being created. </LI>

<DD>Handle of the thread being created. The thread being created is not the current thread. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>If the virtual device sets the carry flag to prevent creation the thread, it should free any system resource it may have allocated to support the thread. </P>

<P>Interrupt simulation is not permitted in the new thread during this message. </P>

<P>Note that this message is not sent when a new virtual machine is created, even though each virtual machine also comes with a thread. Therefore, if you need to do something whenever a new thread is created, even if it is the thread of a virtual machine, you need to perform the operation on the <B>VM_Create</B> message as well. </P>
