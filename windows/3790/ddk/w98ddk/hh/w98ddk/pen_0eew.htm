<P>The pen user interface (PENUI.DLL) library contains the user-interface functions of the pen Unidriver. These functions provide a simple configuration dialog box that queries for the pen device model, the COM port, and whether to provide OEM-specific data (if the tablet supports it). </P>

<P>If desired, an OEM developer can replace or enhance the user interface, by providing a property sheet for Windows 95, thus gaining additional marketability and user recognition. The pen Unidriver maintains its interface code as a separate library to facilitate such enhancements or a complete replacement of the library by the OEM. </P>

<P>The sample pen user interface source code is in the directory \PEN\SAMPLES\PENUI of the installed Windows 95 DDK. This sample can be enhanced or used as a model for the source code of a DLL that completely replaces the pen user interface library. </P>
