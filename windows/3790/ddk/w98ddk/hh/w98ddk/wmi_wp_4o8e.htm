<P>Microsoft has implemented a program whereby an IHV, OEM, or ISV can freely distribute WBEM binaries with their offerings, without incurring a royalty. This means that a single management solution is possible for all Win32 platforms. It also means that vendors do not need to wait until Windows 2000 becomes a significant contributor to their sales effort before they adopt WBEM and WMI. The WBEM Win32 provider provides significant instrumentation data by itself in the Windows 95 and Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 environments. Later, OEMs and IHVs can add significantly to this data set by using WMI to provide custom instrumentation data for their customers who upgrade to Windows®&nbsp;98 and Windows&nbsp;2000.</P>
