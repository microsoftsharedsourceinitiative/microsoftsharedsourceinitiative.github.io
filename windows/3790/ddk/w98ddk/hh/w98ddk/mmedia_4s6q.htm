<P>This section applies to your driver only if you need to add new MCI commands or provide extensions to the MCI command set. </P>

<P class=proch><B><IMG SRC="../images/wedge.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Do the following to add or extend a command set</B>

<OL>
	<LI>Define the new MCI messages you plan to support with your driver. </LI>

	<LI>Define new structures and flags for this command to use with <B>mciSendCommand</B>. 
<P>MCI messages use <I>lParam2</I> as a pointer to a structure, and use <I>lParam1</I> as a bit member for the flags associated with the message. A flag exists for each member in the structure that accepts data from the calling application. The application sets the flag in the bit member of <I>lParam1</I> to indicate a value is assigned to a particular member. Flags also specify options without parameters and these flags do not correspond to a member in the structure. 
</LI>

	<LI>Create a command table that MCI will use to translate string commands sent through <B>mciSendString</B> into the command messages and structures used by your driver. </LI>

	<LI>Support the new messages in your driver's <B>DriverProc</B>. </LI>

	<LI>Register the new command table with MCI in your driver's DRV_LOAD procedure. </LI>
