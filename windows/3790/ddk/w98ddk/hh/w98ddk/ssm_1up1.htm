<P>There are 6 log files created by default: </P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="ssm_6uxx.htm">SSM-HEAP.LOG</A> </P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="ssm_4ox1.htm">SSM-HEAP16.LOG</A> </P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="ssm_8pph.htm">SSM-GDI.LOG</A> </P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="ssm_8pph.htm">SSM-USER.LOG</A> </P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="ssm_9uhx.htm">SSM-MOD16.LOG</A> </P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="ssm_223p.htm">SSM-ATOM.LOG</A> </P>

<P>See the corresponding pages for these log files for details on what one should expect to find in these files and how to interpret their meaning. </P>

<P>If during any automated test, including MTTF and EZPC, we detect that any of the 16-bit resources drop to 30% available or, for 32-bit heap memory, the Memory Load (Percent used) goes to 95%, we consider this critical and go ahead and snap full detailed information. </P>

<P>If during any snapshot, SSM finds a 10% delta decrease in a specific item within a resource, we engage full system logging for that data item only. For example, one of the following items: 

<UL>
	<LI>GDI resource usage </LI>

	<LI>USER resource usage </LI>

	<LI>16-bit heaps </LI>

	<LI>32-bit heaps </LI>
</UL>

<P>Note that because a specific process appears to leak memory, it may not mean that that process is a leaking application. It could be that the process is legitimately using the windows API set to perform some function and the memory is being lost in that API. Care should be taken that each memory allocation in an application calls the necessary API to free that resource. Otherwise, the application will leak memory and this tool will correctly identify the problem. </P>

<P>After you have completed the tests, you may start SSM and choose Analyze/Analyze or Heap 32 /GDI/User/Heap 16. The output will be all objects whose delta was less than zero except in the special case of Heap 16 and Heap 32. If the Free values for either of these increases, the value is considered a decrease in that object's availability to the operating system. </P>

<P>If you wish to get a granular look at all snapshots, choose Analyze and Filter and select one of the object types to filter. The dialog that appears will give you a list of all elements uniquely found in all the snapshots. You can select one and only one of these to get a concurrent snapshot history of the selected element. </P>

<P>If you wish to see a graphical representation of the object's use, select the graph option to graph out all the objects in the list. Note that this option makes the assumption that the log files will always be less than 100. </P>
