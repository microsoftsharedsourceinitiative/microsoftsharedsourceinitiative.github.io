<P>Frees the specified memory block. Uses EAX. </P>

<P>Returns a nonzero value in the EAX register if successful, zero otherwise. 

<DL>
<DT><I>hMem</I></DT>

<DD>Base linear address of the memory block to free. This value must have been returned by the <B>_PageAllocate,</B> <B>_PageReAllocate, </B>or <B>_PageReserve</B> service. You may not free only part of a memory block. </DD>

<DT><I>flags</I></DT>

<DD>Operation flags. Can be zero or PR_STATIC, which specifies that the memory block being freed was allocated as PC_STATIC. If the memory block was allocated as PC_STATIC, but the PR_STATIC field is not also specified, the free will fail. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>Virtual devices that allocate PG_VM or PG_HOOKED pages must free these pages when the associated virtual machine is destroyed. PG_SYS pages do not need to be freed when Windows exits. </P>

<P>If a virtual device maps a memory block into the V86 address space (using the <B>_MapIntoV86</B> service), it should unmap the memory block before attempting to free it. </P>

<P>It is not an error to free memory which is all or partially locked. </P>

<P>It is not necessary to decommit the memory inside a memory block before freeing it. Freeing a memory block automatically decommits its contents. </P>
