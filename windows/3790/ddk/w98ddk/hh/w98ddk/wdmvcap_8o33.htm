<DL>
<DT><B>ExtendedHeaderSize</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the size of this structure.</DD>

<DT><B>dwFrameFlags</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies flags indicating additional information about the frame captured. When capturing, the driver sets this field using the flags discussed in the following <B>Comments</B> section.</DD>

<DT><B>PictureNumber</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies a count representing the current picture number. The counter is reset to zero when the stream is placed in the run state. </DD>

<DT><B>DropCount</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of pictures that were not captured. When capturing, the driver sets this field. This counter should be incremented whenever a frame should have been captured but was not; this condition usually arises when no buffers were available during capture. </DD>

<DT><B>hDirectDraw</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the user-mode handle to DirectDraw. This handle is only provided to the driver when capturing to a DirectDraw surface for preview or overlay purposes.</DD>

<DT><B>hSurfaceHandle</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the user-mode handle to the DirectDraw surface. This handle is only provided to the driver when capturing to a DirectDraw surface for preview or overlay purposes.</DD>

<DT><B>DirectDrawRect</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the portion of the DirectDraw surface that has been locked. This is normally the entire surface.</DD>

<DT><B>Reserved1</B></DT>

<DD>This field is reserved and should not be used by a driver.</DD>

<DT><B>Reserved2</B></DT>

<DD>This field is reserved and should not be used by a driver.</DD>

<DT><B>Reserved3</B></DT>

<DD>This field is reserved and should not be used by a driver.</DD>

<DT><B>Reserved4</B></DT>

<DD>This field is reserved and should not be used by a driver.
</DD>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>The <B>PictureNumber</B> member count represents the idealized count of the current picture, which is calculated in one of two ways:

<UL>
	<LI>Measure the time since the stream was started and divide by the frame duration. This method is appropriate for devices that do not provide their own clock.</LI>

	<LI>Add together the count of frames captured and the count of frame dropped. This method is appropriate for device that provide their own clock.</LI>
</UL>

<P>When calculating the <B>PictureNumber</B> and <B>DropCount</B>, it is important to use the frame duration specified when the stream is opened, which may not necessarily match the rate at which the device is actually producing images. For example, a USB camera may only produce images at 7.5 fps, but a client could open the stream at 8 fps. In this case, all calculations should use the 8 fps number. </P>

<P>The <B>dwFrameFlags</B> member is set by the driver using the following flags.</P>
