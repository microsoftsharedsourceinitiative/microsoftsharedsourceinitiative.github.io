<P>Once you have installed the files, you can start UniTool and begin creating a minidriver. </P>

<P class=proch><B><IMG SRC="../images/wedge.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>To start UniTool</B>

<OL>
	<LI>From the Program Manager File menu, choose the Run command.</LI>

	<LI>Type <B>unitool</B> in the Command Line text box.</LI>

	<LI>Choose the <B>OK</B> button.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Once you have started UniTool, from the File menu, choose the New command. After you choose the New command, the Type of New File dialog box appears in the Main window. Choose the <B>MiniDriver</B> button. UniTool displays a second dialog box that prompts you for the name of your minidriver, the name of the directory in which it will be stored, and the name of the source minidriver. The Source Minidriver list box contains the names of six types of minidrivers:

<UL>
	<LI>Base Driver</LI>

	<LI>Epson 9-Pin Driver</LI>

	<LI>Epson 24-Pin Driver</LI>

	<LI>IBM 24-Pin Driver</LI>

	<LI>HP Driver for HP printers that use Printer Control Language (PCL)</LI>

	<LI>HP PaintJet Driver</LI>
</UL>

<P>The selection you make depends on the type of printer for which you are developing a minidriver. If the printer's resolution and command set are compatible with that of a 9- or 24-pin Epson or IBM printer, choose the corresponding entry from the list box. Similarly, if the printer supports Hewlett-Packard printers that use PCL, choose HPPCL Driver. However, if the printer's resolution or command set is unique and differs significantly from the available choices, choose Base Driver. </P>

<P>The new minidriver will be named DICONIX.DRV, its source files will be stored in the C<I>:\driver\minidriv\diconix</I> directory, and these files will actually be modifications of the files for the 9-pin Epson minidriver. (The Diconix printer emulates both Epson and IBM printers; however, the default emulation and the factory switch settings are Epson compatible. Therefore, the Epson 9-Pin Driver was chosen as the minidriver source. However, unlike most 9-pin printers that are Epson compatible, the horizontal and vertical resolutions supported by the Diconix differ from the horizontal and vertical resolutions supported by the Epson printer. This means that it will be necessary to specify new master units for the Diconix minidriver.)</P>

<P>Once you've created your new minidriver directory and installed the appropriate files, you can begin initializing your minidriver's data table. If you've selected the Base Driver as your starting point, or if your printer does not support the same resolutions as one of the compatible minidrivers, it will be necessary to specify master units. See <A HREF="mstunits_8orl.htm">Specifying Master Units and Minidriver Data</A>, for help in accomplishing this task. If, on the other hand, your printer uses the same resolutions as one of the source minidrivers, you can immediately begin specifying control information. See <A HREF="cntlinfo_6ywe.htm">Specifying Control Information</A>, for help in accomplishing this task.</P>
