<P>Single-frame data capture supports simple video capture. Applications might use this form of data capture to record animated sequences created frame-by-frame or, to capture a single still image, such as a photograph. </P>

<P>This data transfer model typically involves a high data-transfer rate. It is similar to streaming data, except it does not require the continuous transfer of data. </P>

<P class=proch><B><IMG SRC="../images/wedge.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>The following sequence of operations occurs when a client application requests the transfer of a single video frame</B>

<OL>
	<LI>The client allocates the memory for the data buffer. </LI>

	<LI>The client sets a pointer to the empty data buffer in a data structure and sends the device driver a pointer to it. </LI>

	<LI>When the device driver receives the messages to capture data, it fills the data buffer with information from the frame buffer and updates the data structure. </LI>

	<LI>When the device driver has filled a data buffer, it returns control to the client. </LI>

	<LI>After the client has finished with the data, it frees the memory used for the data. </LI>
