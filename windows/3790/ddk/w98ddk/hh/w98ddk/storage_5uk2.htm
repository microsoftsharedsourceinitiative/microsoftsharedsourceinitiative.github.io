<P>The FILE_COMMIT_ASYNC flag is provided as an optimization. By default, commits are synchronous and do not return to the user without flushing the data to the disk. There are certain kinds of applications that make a high number of commit calls and committing the data asynchronously substantially improves the performance of such applications. The IFS manager turns this flag on based on a system registry setting. FSDs should not attempt to interpret the system registry settings independent of the IFS manager. There are certain situations such as the presence of volume locks, when the IFS manager forces all commit operations to be synchronous. </P>
