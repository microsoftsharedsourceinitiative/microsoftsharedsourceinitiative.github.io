<P>Instance names are used by management applications to associate the information returned in a data block to the physical device or software component that generated the information. WMI uses the instance name to determine to which device a request should be routed. Therefore, it is required that all instance names for different instances of a data block be unique. Because instances of a data block may come from different drivers, WMI automatically detects an instance name collision and mangles the instance name in some cases.</P>

<P>A data provider can register or update each data block that it provides to have either dynamic or static instance names. A data provider should register a data block to have static instance names when the number of instances or their names change slowly because a data provider must call <B>IoWMIRegistrationControl</B> for each change. Static instance names optimize WMI requests because the data provider does not need to return the instance names in the WNODE_ALL_DATA query results. Also, rather than a full instance name being specified in the WNODE_SINGLE_INSTANCE and WNODE_SINGLE_ITEM, an instance index is specified. When registering, a data provider can specify the full instance names for each instance or a base name to which WMI appends an index. WMI detects instance name collisions for static instance data blocks at registration and automatically mangles their names.</P>

<P>A data block should be registered with dynamic instances when the count of instances or their names change frequently. Examples might be data blocks whose instances names are the process ID of a process or the IP address of a TCP/IP connection. When the instance names or count change, no notification of WMI is required. However, all WNODEs passed to the data provider or returned from the data provider must have the full instance name specified. In addition, the data provider must ensure that each instance name is unique among all providers of that dynamic data block because WMI does not detect instance name collisions for dynamic instance data blocks. </P>

<P>WMI provides the <B>IoWMIAllocateInstanceIds</B> function to let devices that provide dynamic instance names allocate a range of instance IDs for a GUID that are guaranteed to be unique. A data provider can use this function if it is concerned that the dynamic instance names chosen by it for a particular GUID might not be unique. </P>

<P>For example, the first time this function is called with a GUID of {C8FF15D0-7402-11d0-A839-00AA0060D45C}, it is also passed with <I>InstanceCount </I>set to 3 and <I>*FirstInstanceId </I>returns<I> </I>1. The next time this function is called with that GUID, it is passed <I>InstanceCount</I> set to 1 and <I>*FirstInstanceId </I>returns 4. The first caller must append 1 to its first instance name, 2 to its second, and 3 to its third, while the second caller would append 4 to its instance name. </P>
