<P>The virtual driver receives the VPEND_LOAD message every time a process registers to receive interrupt callbacks from the virtual pen driver. When sent from the ring 3 driver, the DS:SI registers (or SS:SI, if DS=SS) should contain a pointer to a <B>VpenD_Init</B> structure. The virtual driver stores all the information in the <B>_VpenD_Register</B> structure for future reference. </P>

<P>This routine can be called from either a driver in the system virtual machine (VM) or from a driver in some MS-DOS VM. Every time the user switches VMs, the system notifies the virtual pen driver. This enables the virtual pen driver to route pen packets to the current VM, if a device in that VM has registered to receive pen information. This functionality is not provided in the sample virtual pen driver code. </P>

<P>At this time, only one device in each VM can register to receive pen packet information. If a driver has already registered for the VM that this driver is currently requesting to serve, this routine will return DRV_FAILURE. </P>
