<P>The Supported Attributes list box lists the names of fourteen dialog boxes. The values and strings that appear in these dialog boxes correspond to values and strings which were entered in the corresponding dialog boxes accessible through the cascading menus in the Printer Data menu. By double-clicking any of the entries in the Supported Attributes list box, you display a dialog box with data previously entered through the commands and corresponding dialog boxes in the Printer Data menu. Here, you may indicate which data applies to your device and which does not; you may also specify values to which the driver will default when it is first installed. The following list briefly describes each of the fourteen dialog boxes accessible from the Supported Attributes list box.</P>
