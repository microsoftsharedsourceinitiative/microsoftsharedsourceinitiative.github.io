<P>This service is called to disconnect a resource previously connected using the IFSMgr_SetupConnection service. For this service to work, the same I/O request structure that was passed to the IFSMgr_SetupConnection service must be passed in. The IFS relies on the validity of certain fields in the associated IFS request structure that were initialized when the connection was originally established. This service can be only called to disconnect a connection that was previously established using the IFSMgr_SetupConnection service.
