<P>You should typically set the ANSI-approved Version field, in the INQUIRY response, to at least 2.</P>

<P>Install the debug version of SCSI1HLP, CDVSD and CDTSD. Check for the following message:</P>

<P class=indent1>SCSI-I helper VSD found SCSI-1 CD-ROM, taking over</P>

<P>This message indicates that SCSI1HLP believes that an old CD-ROM drive is being used because the ANSI-approved Version field is less than 2. In the SCSI II Specification for the returned INQUIRY packet, byte offset 2, the first three bits, there is a 3-bit ANSI value field. ATAPI normally returns 0 in this field, but you need to put a 2 in that field. For example, SCSI1HLP.VXD inspects this field to determine whether it needs to "help" the command. The port driver ESDI_506.PDR changes that field to 2 also.</P>

<P>SCSI1HLP is then installed to allow old legacy CD-ROM drives (with unusual commands) to work. This will only happen if the INQUIRY command returns a value of less than 2 in the ANSI-approved version field. Thus, new SCSI miniport drivers typically should always set the ANSI-approved version field to 2 or higher.</P>

<P>Note that SCSI1HLP will also load itself if it finds the DCB_DEV2_ATAPI_DEVICE bit set (see below), but you will not see it reported to the debugger.</P>
