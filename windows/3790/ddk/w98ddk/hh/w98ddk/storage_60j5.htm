<P>This service broadcasts a Plug and Play event to all devices and applications in the system. The broadcast is issued on a number of operations which are listed in the following. It returns the result of the operation. On query operations, an error is returned if any of the recipients of the broadcast refuses the query. Valid devices include local and net drives as well as network transports and resources. When a network transport or resource is removed, all drives attached to them are removed as well. 

<DL>
<DT><I>Message</I> </DT>

<DD>Supplies the operation for which the broadcast is being issued. The defined operations are described in the following.
