<P>Microsoft® Windows® 98 uses a Win32® driver model (WDM) streaming class driver to control video cards. Certain components on the video card (such as television tuners, video decoders, and video crossbars) are controlled by drivers that work with the class driver called minidrivers. Using minidrivers allows hardware vendors to create video drivers for various cards by simply installing the minidrivers that work with the devices on the card.</P>

<P>Several hardware manufacturers have adopted a modular approach to the building of video cards. This approach uses the I<SUP>2</SUP>C bus to connect devices to a master device. The master device sends commands to the devices for setting and reading the properties of the devices.</P>

<P>For video cards that use the I<SUP>2</SUP>C bus, the minidrivers tell the master device which device and what command to send on the I<SUP>2</SUP>C bus. The video class driver provided with Windows 98 provides an interface to minidrivers that handles the details of controlling the I<SUP>2</SUP>C bus.</P>

<P>To support Video Drivers and the I<SUP>2</SUP>C Bus, see the current DirectX DDK.</P>

<P>The following topics describe how to develop miniVDD interfaces for display devices that are I<SUP>2</SUP>C masters.</P>
