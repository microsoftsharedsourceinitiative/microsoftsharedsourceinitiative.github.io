<P>The following sample was taken from the S3 ViRGE INF file. It is a partial listing of the <B>AddReg</B> section for the S3 driver. This sample defines custom refresh rates for 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1152x864, and 1280x1024. </P>

<P>Because 1600x1200 has no custom refresh rates specified, only "Adapter Default" is available to the user at that resolution. Modes at 16 bpp and higher color depths use the same custom refresh rates specified for their 8 bpp counterparts.</P>

<P>As an example, if this part does not support 75 Hz at 1024x768x16bpp, the line HKR,"MODES\16\1024,768 is replaced by HKR,"MODES\16\1024,768",,,"43,60,70,85"</P>

<P>This new set of custom refresh rates overrides the 8-bpp rates for this mode only.</P>
