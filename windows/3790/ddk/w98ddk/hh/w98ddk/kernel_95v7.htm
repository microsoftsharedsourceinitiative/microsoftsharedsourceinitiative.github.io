<P>Raises or lowers the execution priority of the specified virtual machine. The service adds the specified boost to the virtual machine's current execution priority. Uses Flags.

<DL>
<DT><I>PriorityBoost</I></DT>

<DD>A signed integer value representing the positive or negative priority boost for the virtual machine. This parameter must be a value such that when added to the current execution priority, the result is within the range Reserved_Low_Boost to Reserved_High_Boost. The following lists some common priority boost values, from lowest to highest:

<P>Because the nonsuspended virtual machine with the highest execution priority is always the current virtual machine, this service causes a task switch under two circumstances: 

<UL>
	<LI>The execution priority of the current virtual machine is lowered (EAX is negative), and there is another virtual machine with a higher priority that is not suspended. </LI>

	<LI>The execution of a nonsuspended virtual machine which is not the current virtual machine is raised (EAX is positive) higher than the current virtual machine's execution priority. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Even if the current virtual machine is in a critical section, a task switch will still occur if the priority of another nonsuspended virtual machine is raised higher than the current virtual machine's priority. However, this will only occur when a virtual machine is given a time-critical boost, for example, to simulate a hardware interrupt. </P>

<P>It is often more convenient to call the <B>Call_Priority_VM_Event</B> service than to call this service directly. </P>
