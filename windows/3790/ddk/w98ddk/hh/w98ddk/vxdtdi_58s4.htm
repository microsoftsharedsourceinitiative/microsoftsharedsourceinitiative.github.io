<H4>Parameters</H4>

<DL>
<DT><I>TO</I> </DT>

<DD>Time-out value indicating how long to wait for the disconnection to complete. It has the same semantics as the <I>TO</I> value for <B>TdiConnect</B>.</DD>

<DT><I>Flags</I> </DT>

<DD>Identifies the disconnect type. It may take on one of the following values: 

<DL>
<DT>TDI_DISCONNECT_ABORT </DT>

<DD>Specifies that this is to be an abortive disconnect.</DD>

<DT>TDI_DISCONNECT_WAIT </DT>

<DD>Specifies that this is a disconnect wait request. This type of request results in no protocol action. The disconnect request is in a pending state until the remote peer issues a disconnect. This command may be used to receive disconnect notifications without a disconnect event handler, although the event handler approach is the recommended mechanism.</DD>
</DL>


<P>If neither of these flags is set, the disconnect is considered to be graceful.

<DD>Unused and may be set to NULL.</DD>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>The <B>TdiDisconnect</B> function is called through <B>TdiDisconnectEntry</B> pointer in the <B>TdiDispatchTable</B> structure.</P>

<P>This is the primitive to disconnect an established connection. The connection to be disconnected is specified through Request-&gt;Handle.<I>ConnectionContext</I>. A connection may be abortively or gracefully disconnected. An abortive disconnect results in a RST being sent. A graceful disconnect results in a FIN being sent, and the graceful disconnect will not complete until the FIN is successfully acknowledged. or the disconnect times out.</P>

<P>If a connection is being gracefully disconnected, the disconnection is not complete until both sides have disconnected. A client may be notified of the remote peers disconnect through a <B>DisconnectWait</B> request or a  disconnect event notification. After a client has been notified that the remote side has disconnected and had a graceful disconnect of its own complete, the connection is gone. An abortive disconnect, however, is unilateral. Once either side has issued an abortive disconnect, the connection is terminated.</P>

<P>A disconnect results in all outstanding requests on the connection completing. A graceful disconnect does not complete until all outstanding send requests have been sent and acknowledged, or until the disconnect time-out occurs. </P>
