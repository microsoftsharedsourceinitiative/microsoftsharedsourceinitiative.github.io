<H4>Call With</H4>

<P>EBX: Contains the VM handle (always the currently executing VM). </P>

<P>EBP: Points to the Windows VM's Client Registers. Client registers contain the VESA call values. </P>

<H4>Return Values</H4>

<P>Save everything that you use. CY returned means that the mini-VDD completely handled the VESA call and that the VESA.COM or VESA BIOS should not be called. NC returned means that the mini-VDD did not completely handle the call and that the VESA.COM or VESA BIOS should be called. The client registers contain the return values from the VESA call if the mini-VDD handles the call. </P>

<H4>Remarks</H4>

<P>This routine is the "hook" by which a mini-VDD could implement an entire Ring 0 protected mode VESA support. This is recommended, since it eliminates all of the problems of old VESA.COM programs. It also allows much faster VESA performance since the functions are supported at 32 bit Ring 0. </P>

<P>The mini-VDD's VESA support decides what to do based on values in the Client registers. For example, Client_AX will contain 4Fxx indicating what VESA call the application is doing. Then, the mini-VDD can handle the call, filling in return structures (such as those returned by VESA function 4F00h), etc., and return CY to the Main VDD. </P>

<P>This routine could also be used to setup a VESA call while still letting the Ring 3 VESA BIOS handle the call. The mini-VDD would do what it wants to do, and then return NC indicating that the Main VDD should call the Ring 3 VESA BIOS or VESA.COM program. </P>
