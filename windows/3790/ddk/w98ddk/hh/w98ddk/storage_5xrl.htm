<P>This service inserts a numeric tail into a "basis" name previously constructed by calling the CreateBasis service. If the numeric tail (which is always a single-byte encoding), when appended to the primary name of the basis results in a primary name that is longer than 8 bytes, the primary name is truncated from the right until the truncated primary name with the numeric tail fits in an 8-byte multibyte OEM string. This routine takes care of multibyte encodings while generating the basis name and ensures that when the Unicode basis name is converted into a BCS string, the primary name will still not exceed 8 bytes. A typical numeric tail has the form "~xxx" where xxx stands for the numeric value the tail is to be generated from.
