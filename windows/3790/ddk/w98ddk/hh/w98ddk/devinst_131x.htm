<P>One or more sections must be put into the INF file that causes the files on an installation diskette to be copied to specific sub directories on the hard disk, and these section names must be listed in the CX2590.Install section in the INF file. Corporation X is providing two files to support the device on one installation diskette: 

<UL>
	<LI>A SCSI miniport driver with the filename CX2590.MPD, which must be copied from a device installation diskette to the directory %WINROOT%\SYSTEM\IOSUBSYS on the Windows 95 computer. </LI>

	<LI>A utility program with the filename SRSUTIL.EXE, which must be copied from a device installation diskette to the BIN sub directory of the Windows 95 computer boot directory. The BIN subdirectory of the computer boot directory is the default destination directory for this installation. </LI>

	<LI>Both CX2590.MPD and SRSUTIL.EXE fit on one installation diskette. The descriptive name of a device installation diskette is "CX2590 Windows 95 Installation Disk" (this is the name of the installation diskette that is displayed to the user during the device installation procedure). The installation diskette label is Instd1 and there is no serial number on the installation diskette. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The following sections walk through the procedure of using Infedit to add the required sections and Install section items to the INF file. Note that in this example case, no files have to be renamed when they are copied from the diskette to the hard disk; if renaming was required, a Rename Files-type section would have to be put into the INF file. Also note that for this example CX2590 installation, no preexisting files on the hard drive, such as obsolete drivers, have to be deleted as part of the overall file copying strategy; if there were such requirements, a DelFiles-type section would have to be put in the INF file. </P>
