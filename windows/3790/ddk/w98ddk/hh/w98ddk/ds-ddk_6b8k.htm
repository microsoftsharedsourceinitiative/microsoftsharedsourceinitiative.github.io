<P>Positional audio is a very compelling feature that adds to the realism and playability of most 3-D action games. Unfortunately, the algorithms needed to position a sound are very complex. Even using a scaled-down software implementation, real games can only position one or two sounds without hardware support. </P>

<P>With hardware support, games can position as many sounds as the hardware supports. The positioning is typically done using a more powerful algorithm than the DirectSound software implementation, so the positioning is more realistic and compelling. Finally, high-performance games scale to the hardware capabilities, so they may begin using more 3-D sounds if the hardware support is present, increasing the realism and sound quality. </P>

<P>3-D positional acceleration is useful only if the card also supports hardware mixing. 3-D support is useful on some but not all channels; at least one channel (the one used by the DirectSound software mixer) never uses 3-D positioning. The same bus performance issues apply: on fast PCI buses, sound cards can position streaming sound buffers, while on ISA buses 3-D support is most useful for static buffers located in on-board memory. However, since 3-D positioning is such a CPU-intensive task, it might be worth the bus traffic to support two streaming buffers on an ISA card: one for 3-D positioning, and the other for use by the DirectSound software mixer. Sound card manufacturers must evaluate the trade-offs involved. </P>

<P>The specific details of 3-D positional support can be derived from the DirectX SDK, which describes the 3-D parameters that an application can specify. A hardware implementation is not required to take advantage of all of these parameters; the hardware should position streams using whichever parameters are necessary. For example, sound direction and velocity parameters can be used to determine Doppler shifting effects, but hardware is not required to do so since this is not a critical feature. </P>

<P>The following 3-D positional effects (listed in order of importance) are supported: 

<UL>
	<LI>Set sound position, set listener position and orientation — positions sound in 3-D space. </LI>

	<LI>Set rolloff and distance factor of current environment — describes how the volume changes in response to distance from the source. </LI>

	<LI>Set sound cone (orientation, angle, ambient volume) — describes sound projection characteristics. </LI>

	<LI>Set direction and velocity of sounds and listener, set Doppler factor — used to calculate Doppler effects (not to trace the sound path or the listener path). </LI>
</UL>
