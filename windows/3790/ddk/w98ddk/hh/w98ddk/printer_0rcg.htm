<P>The <B>ReadPort</B> function supports bidirectional printers. If there is any data in the printer, the <B>ReadPort</B> function returns all the data. If there is no response from the printer, the <B>ReadPort</B> function waits long enough to ensure that there is no data coming from the printer and then returns an error. </P>

<P>The port monitor <B>ReadPort</B> function is called by a language monitor, which is the only component of the spooler subsystem that is capable of interpreting the data read from the printer. A language monitor can create a thread to asynchronously call the port monitor <B>ReadPort</B> function to query unsolicited data from the printer at timed intervals of say, a few seconds. </P>

<P>The port monitor <B>ReadPort</B> function must not alter the data stream read from the printer in any way, but just return it to the language monitor caller for interpretation. </P>

<P>The printer driver that is associated with the language monitor that interprets the data read from the printer can get that information by calling the new Windows 95 GDI functions <B>DrvGetPrinterData</B> and <B>DrvSetPrinterData</B>. Following are guidelines for calling <B>DrvGetPrinterData</B> and <B>DrvSetPrinterData</B> in your printer driver: 

<UL>
	<LI>Your printer driver must be reentrant. </LI>

	<LI>Do not use <B>DrvGetPrinterData</B> or <B>DrvSetPrinterData</B> calls within the printer driver <B>Enable</B> or <B>Disable</B> functions. </LI>

	<LI>The ideal places to use <B>DrvGetPrinterData</B> or <B>DrvSetPrinterData</B> calls are in the printer driver <B>DevInstall</B> function or when the printer driver <B>ExtDeviceMode</B> function is called with the DM_Prompt flag set in the <I>wMode</I> parameter (at which time the driver is reentrant and ExtDeviceMode is not being called by the <B>Enable</B> function). </LI>
