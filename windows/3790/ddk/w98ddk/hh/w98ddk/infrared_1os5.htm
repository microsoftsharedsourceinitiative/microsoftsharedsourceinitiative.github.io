<P>The PC connectivity world today is mostly wired and the cable type dictates the application. A link over a parallel cable means printing, while a link over a serial cable serves a modem. Right now, a user needs consciously to start a connection over the cable that matches the application. Starting a connection is a hassle that many potential computer users just won't put up with. </P>

<P>Wireless communications are going to play an increasingly important role in computers, particularly for mobile users. As more and more wireless PC connectivity hardware and software become available, applications will provide new connectivity features. Applications will initiate connectivity on an as-needed basis and a user will not even need to know the connection type in order to use it. </P>

<P>Because of its low-cost and simple implementation, the first widely-available wireless connectivity medium for PCs is infrared (IR). The engineering requirements are straight-forward and the component cost is under $5 per device. Computer system and peripheral makers are already integrating infrared devices with computers and printers. </P>
