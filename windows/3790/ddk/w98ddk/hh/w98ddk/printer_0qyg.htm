<P>The Windows 95 spooler and Windows NT/Windows 2000 spooler are similar in many ways. One important difference is that in Windows NT/Windows 2000 the router, local print provider (local spooler), default print processor and default monitor components were each packaged in a separate DLL. In Windows 95, for performance reasons, the default router, local print provider, and port monitor are packaged in one DLL (SPOOLSS.DLL). If you decide to add a print processor, port monitor, or language monitor to the Windows 95 spooler subsystem, you will have to build a separate DLL that is callable by the spooler DLL. Guidelines on how to do this for print processors and port monitors are given in <I>About Print Processors</I>, <I>About Port Monitors</I>, and <I>About Language Monitors</I>. Instructions on how to install these DLLs, either by calling Win32 APIs or adding extensions to printer .INF files are given in <I>Installing Printer Support</I>. Sample source code for a print processor, port monitor, and language monitor are in the SAMPLES directory of the DDK. </P>

<P>Highlights of other similarities and differences between the Windows NT/Windows 2000 and Windows 95 spooler include: 

<UL>
	<LI>The Windows 95 and Windows NT/Windows 2000 spooler APIs are compatible. However, there are some variations in data structures. </LI>

	<LI>Language monitors are extensions to printer drivers in Windows 95. For more information, see <I>About Language Monitors</I>. </LI>

	<LI>Windows 95 offers better bidirectional printer support than Windows NT/Windows 2000. For more information, see <I>About Language Monitors</I>. </LI>

	<LI>Windows 95 has some print processor and monitor extensions. Print processor extensions are described in <I>About Print Processors</I>. </LI>

	<LI>Windows 95 uses an enhanced metafiles (EMF) spool file format instead of the journal spool file format used by Windows NT/Windows 2000. </LI>
