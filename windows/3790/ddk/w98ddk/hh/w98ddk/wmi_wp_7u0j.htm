<P>IHVs and OEMs should see WMI as a technology that can add value to their hardware and differentiate it from that of a competitor. For example, NIC vendors can use WMI to send an event if a loosely plugged-in cable falls free and the Ethernet signal is lost. The NIC vendor can accomplish this by merely adding code to the NDIS miniport driver. The vendor does not need to write any WMI code. Other examples include sending temperature alerts, or detecting when the number of bad blocks or sectors on a hard disk drive have crossed a critical limit, or sending the appropriate notification. An IHV/OEM can write a new class driver, for example, to report temperature, fan control data, and so on, and can populate WBEM with the appropriate instrumentation information. </P>
