<P>This section describes the Card Services binding for VxD clients. The calling mechanism is the VxD service interface — any VxDs requiring access to Card Services must include PCCARD.INC. This include file contains the PCCARD service-access table that allows the client VxD to use the <B>VxDCall</B> macro to call Card Services. </P>

<P>The VxD Card Services interface is not available during system initialization. Clients should register with Card Services while processing the Init_Complete message. Clients registering at this point still have the opportunity to abort loading if Card Services is not present. </P>

<P>MASM version 6.<I>x</I> is required for the structure definitions in the Card Services interface. </P>
