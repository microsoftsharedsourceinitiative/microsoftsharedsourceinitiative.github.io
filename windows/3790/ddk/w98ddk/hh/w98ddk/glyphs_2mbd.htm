<P>In Windows® 95, ICM profiles are implicitly associated with printer models. This is different from Windows® 98 and later, where ICM profiles are explicitly associated with printer instances using the <B>AssociateColorProfileWithDevice</B> function. The implicit association is accomplished with the following procedure. When looking for profiles associated with a printer model, the operating system computes a four-byte manufacturer ID and a four-byte model ID from the model name of the printer using the algorithm in <A HREF="glyphs_80fn.htm">Sample Code for Printer Profiles</A>. It then assumes that all profiles which specify this combination of manufacturer ID and model ID in their header belong to this model.</P>

<P>There are often situations where multiple models from the same manufacturer have similar color characteristics and the same color profile(s) can be used for these models. This is a problem due to the implicit association done by the operating system, since the manufacturer needs to duplicate the profiles but have different model IDs. This leads to wasted disk space. To circumvent this problem, Windows 95 allows the printer driver to specify the manufacturer ID and model ID by calling <B>DeviceCapabilities(</B>DC_ICC_MANUFACTURER<B>)</B> and <B>DeviceCapabilities(</B>DC_ICC_MODEL) before it does its automatic computation.</P>

<P>If the driver specifies these IDs, then Windows 95 searches for profiles with these IDs. This allows a driver supporting different models with the same color profiles to always return the IDs specified in the profiles. Windows 95 uses the same set of profiles for both printer models.</P>

<P>To support Windows 95 drivers that have this behavior, Windows 98 continues to call <B>DeviceCapabilities</B>, and if a manufacturer and model ID is returned, it mimics Windows 95 behavior to search for profiles. However, this results in loss of functionality in Windows 98:

<UL>
	<LI>Profiles are associated with printer models instead of printer instances</LI>

	<LI>Profiles explicitly associated by the user with the printer instance are ignored.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Therefore, printer vendors writing drivers that run on Windows 95/98/Me should support these device capabilities but return a failure code at run time if they are running on Windows 98/Me.</P>
