<P>WMI provides WBEM with yet another means for collecting and setting data and events. WBEM is a unifying architecture that allows access to data from a variety of underlying technologies — including Win32, WMI, the Desktop Management Interface (DMI), and the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). WBEM is based upon the Common Information Model (CIM) schema, which is an industry standard driven by the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF). WBEM details can be obtained from http://www.wbem.freerange.com.</P>

<P>WBEM provides a three-tiered approach for collecting and providing management data. This approach consists of a standard mechanism for storing data (a CIM-compliant database), a standard protocol for obtaining and disseminating management data (COM/DCOM; other protocols are also possible and under investigation), and a Win32 DLL known as a <I>WBEM provider</I>. </P>

<P>A WBEM provider supplies instrumentation data for parts of the CIM schema. Microsoft has written a WBEM provider   (the WMI provider)  that  interfaces with the kernel mode WMI component. The kernel mode WMI component provides services that allow WMI-enabled drivers to implement WMI, and also acts as an interface to the WMI provider. </P>

<P>The specifications for writing a WBEM provider are freely available, as are code examples. An IHV/OEM that manufactures hardware and software for end users (for example, still-image scanner manufacturers and printer manufacturers) should consider writing a WBEM provider. For kernel components, the IHV/OEM should implement WMI. </P>

<P>The following diagram provides an overview of the WBEM/WMI architecture. </P>
