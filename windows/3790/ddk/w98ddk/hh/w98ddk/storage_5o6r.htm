<P>To create a safe MBR hook for translation, you can either write an MBR hooker and a corresponding VSD or just write an MBR hooker that sets the <B>smhflgs</B> member to 1. In either case, the MBR hooker must have a <B>SafeMBRHook</B> structure at the beginning of its hook routine, as described in <I>About Vendor-Supplied Drivers</I>. </P>

<P>You do not have to write a VSD if the MBR hooker only has functionality that the Windows 95 IDE driver already supports. In this case, the MBR hooker can set the <B>smhflgs</B> member to 1 on its own so that Windows 95 can take over in protect mode. </P>

<P>If the MBR hooker has functionality that is not already supported by Windows 95, for example, encryption, you must write a VSD or leave your MBR hooker marked as unsafe. If you write a VSD to support the extra functionality in protect mode, the VSD is responsible for setting the <B>smhflgs</B> member to 1 to indicate to Windows 95 that it is safe to take over in protect mode. </P>
