<P>When you build the first version of an INF file for your device, the operating characteristics of the device are well known — even if you are building the INF file to test a hardware prototype on a Windows 95 machine. </P>

<P>For example. consider a fictitious piece of hardware, a SCSI Host Adapter which is built by Corporation X. The name of the device is the CX2590 SCSI Adapter and its Windows 95 device ID is *CX2590. There are no compatible device IDs for this device. All this information can be put into the INF file in a Manufacturer section. </P>

<P>The board has the following resource requirements: 

<UL>
	<LI>Four contiguous IO ports based at 180H, 190H, 1A0h or 1B0h. </LI>

	<LI>One exclusive IRQ chosen from 4,5,9,10,11. </LI>

	<LI>One DMA channel, although the board will work without one. </LI>
</UL>

<P>All of this resource requirements information can be put into the INF file in one or more Log Config-type sections. Use the Infedit Log Config Sections folder to do this. </P>

<P>Corporation X is providing two files to support the device on one installation diskette: 

<UL>
	<LI>A SCSI miniport driver with the filename CX2590.MPD, which must be copied from a device installation diskette to the directory %WINROOT%\SYSTEM\IOSUBSYS on the Windows 95 computer. </LI>

	<LI>A utility program with the filename SRSUTIL.EXE, which must be copied from a device installation diskette to the BIN sub directory of the Windows 95 computer boot directory. The BIN sub directory of the computer boot directory is the default subdirectory for this installation process. </LI>

	<LI>Both CX2590.MPD and SRSUTIL.EXE fit on one installation diskette. The descriptive name of a device installation diskette is "CX2590 Windows 95 Installation Disk" (this is the name of the installation diskette that is displayed to the user during the device installation procedure). The installation diskette label is Instd1 and there is no serial number on the installation diskette. </LI>
</UL>

<P>All of the filename information and the source and destination information for copying the files can put into the INF file in one or more CopyFiles-type sections. Use the Infedit CopyFiles folder to do this. </P>

<P>Two entries must be made under the HKR key of the registry: 

<UL>
	<LI>An entry that specifies the device loader the CX2590; for a block device like a SCSI adapter the device loader is the I/O Supervisor (IOS). </LI>

	<LI>An entry that specifies the filename of the minport driver for the device; in this example, that is the file named CX2590.MPD. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The information that causes these two registry entries to be made at installation time can all be put into the INF file in one or more Add Registry-type sections. Use the Infedit Add Registry Sections folder to do this. </P>
