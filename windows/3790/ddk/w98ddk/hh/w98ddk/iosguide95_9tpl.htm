<P>First refer to the Knowledge Base articles dealing with implementation differences between Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. Some of these articles are listed at the end of this section.</P>

<H4>Plug and Play</H4>

<P>The only major difference between the two is support for Plug and Play under Windows 95. In Windows 95 the PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFO structure will already be populated with the system resources (I/O and memory ranges, DMA channel, and so on) assigned to the controller. In this case the miniport is expected to <I>not</I> “sniff” for the controller.</P>

<P>You might consider setting flags in your code to accomplish conditional compilation (to accommodate both Windows NT and Windows 95).</P>

<H4>Using the ATAPI Miniport Driver Sample Located in the Windows NT 4.0 DDK</H4>

<P>A common issue deals with the Windows 95 IDE/ATAPI port driver (ESDI_506.PDR). Microsoft does not supply the source code of ESDI_506.PDR. However, Microsoft DOES supply the source code for an ATAPI miniport driver in the Windows NT DDK. This driver may be used to replace the functionality of ESDI_506. Windows NT miniport drivers are generally binary compatible with Windows 95 (there are minor differences, for example, Windows NT supports miniport I/O control commands that are not supported by Windows 95). </P>

<P>SCSI miniport driver devices support dynamic reenumeration (hot-swapping), while the ESDI_506.PDR driver does not. To accommodate “hot” device removal and reinstallation, you can modify the miniport driver to detect the addition and removal of the hardware and call CM_Reenumerate_Devnode() to force the system to reenumerate the bus (which detects both removal and arrival of devices). Part of the IOS SCSI reenumeration process is to issue device inquiries to identify new device(s) and obtain the SCSI device's hardware ID. The INF files are scanned to find  a hardware ID match. If a match is found, the "new hardware" popup menu is  avoided, and the process automatically completes. </P>

<P class=proch><B><IMG SRC="../images/wedge.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Here is the general process for setting up the Windows NT ATAPI miniport sample into Windows 95:</B>

<OL>
	<LI>Inspect the file named scsi.inf located in the &lt;windows directory&gt;\inf\ path (or do a grep for "mpd" in the inf\ path). There are two different types of entries, for example:
<P>CopyFiles=@ncr53C9x.mpd

<P>HKR,,PortDriver,,ncr53C9x.mpd

<P>The first item causes the miniport driver (.mpd) to be copied to the <B>\system\iosubsys\</B> path. The second item adds the name of the miniport driver to your entry in the registry. You need to amend scsi.inf to contain your new atapi.mpd, or create your own INF file.
</LI>

	<LI>You can test your miniport driver by manually copying it to the \iosubsys\ path (renaming your binary file atapi.sys to atapi.mpd), and going into the registry to rename ESDI_506.PDR to the name of your miniport driver (atapi.mpd).</LI>

	<LI>For Windows 95, you do not need any other Windows NT files. Windows 95 uses its own port driver, SCSIPORT.PDR to interface your miniport driver.</LI>
