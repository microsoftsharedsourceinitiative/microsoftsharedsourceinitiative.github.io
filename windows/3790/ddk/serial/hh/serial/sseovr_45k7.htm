<P>This section describes the features of Serial and Serenum, the Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;2000 and later system drivers for serial devices.</P>

<P>Serial implements the Serial service, and its executable image is <I>serial.sys</I>. </P>

<P>Serial is used as:

<UL>
	<LI>A function driver for legacy COM and Plug and Play COM ports
<P>Note that a COM port provides a 16550 UART-compatible interface.
</LI>

	<LI>A lower-level device filter driver for a Plug and Play serial device that requires a 16550 UART-compatible interface
<P>An example of this configuration is a serial device on a PCMCIA card.

<P>Serial's operation as a filter driver is identical to its operation as a function driver.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>Serial features the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Plug and Play, power management, and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)</LI>

	<LI>Power policy owner for a serial device stack that includes Serial</LI>

	<LI>Supports an unlimited number of standalone COM ports and multiport boards</LI>

	<LI>Controls interrupts and communication with device hardware</LI>
</UL>

<P>Serenum implements the Serenum service, and its executable image is <I>serenum.sys</I>.</P>

<P>Serenum is an upper-level device filter driver that is used with serial port function drivers to enumerate the following serial devices on an RS-232 port:

<UL>
	<LI>Plug and Play serial devices that comply with Plug and Play External COM Device Specification, Version 1.00, February 28, 1995</LI>

	<LI>Pointer devices that comply with legacy mouse detection in Microsoft Windows NT® 4.0 and earlier versions</LI>
</UL>

<P>The combined operation of Serial and Serenum provides the function of a Plug and Play bus driver for an RS-232 port.</P>

<P>Serenum supports Plug and Play and power management.</P>

<P>Serenum does not support the Windows Driver Model, and should only be used with Windows&nbsp;2000.</P>

<P>Windows&nbsp;2000 provides Serenum to support Serial and other serial port function drivers that need to enumerate an RS-232 port. Hardware vendors do not have to create their own enumerator for RS-232 ports. For example, a device driver can use Serenum to enumerate the serial devices that are attached to the individual RS-232 ports on a multiport device.</P>
