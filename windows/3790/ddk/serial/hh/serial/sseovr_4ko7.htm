<P>A client can use an <A HREF="serref_07qq.htm">IOCTL_SERIAL_SET_TIMEOUTS</A> request to set time-out values that Serial uses for read and write requests. Serial continues to transfer bytes until the requested number of bytes are transferred or a time-out event occurs.</P>

<P>Serial's time-out operation is compliant with the user-mode operation of COM ports that the Win32 Communications API provides. </P>

<P>Note that the time-out operation is not applied to a pending request while it is queued. The time-out operation is applied to a request after the request becomes current (that is, Serial starts to process the request).</P>

<P>For more information on the read and write time-outs, see the following:

<UL>
	<LI><B>SetCommTimeouts</B> function and the COMMTIMEOUTS structure in the Platform SDK documentation</LI>

	<LI>SERIAL_TIMEOUTS structure in the include file <I>%install directory%\inc\ntddser.h</I> in the Windows&nbsp;2000 DDK</LI>
