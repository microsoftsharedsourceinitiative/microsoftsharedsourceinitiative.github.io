<H2><A NAME="ddk_system_supplied_device_setup_classes_dg"></A>System-Supplied Device Setup Classes</H2>

<P>This section lists the system-supplied device setup classes. In the definition for each class, the <B>Class</B> and <B>ClassGuid</B> entries correspond to the values that must be specified in the <A HREF="inf-format_2fzm.htm">INF <B>Version</B> Section</A> of a device's INF file. The GUIDs for system-supplied device setup classes are defined in <I>devguid.h</I>.</P>

<P>Supplying the appropriate class GUID value in the INF for a device, rather than or in addition to the <B>Class=</B><I>class-name</I> entry, significantly improves the performance of system INF searching. In fact, system INFs that do not require either entry, such as those that neither install a new device class installer nor a device driver, sometimes supply <B>ClassGuid={</B>00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000<B>}</B> in their <B>Version</B> sections to cut down on the system's INF searching time.</P>

<P>Following are two lists of system-defined device setup classes:</P>
