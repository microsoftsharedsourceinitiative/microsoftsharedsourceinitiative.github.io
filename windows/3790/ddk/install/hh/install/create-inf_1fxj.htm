<H1><A NAME="ddk_summary_of_inf_sections_dg"></A>Summary of INF Sections</H1>

<P>The following summarizes the system-defined sections that can be used in INF files. System-defined section names are case-insensitive, so <B>version</B>, <B>VERSION</B>, and <B>Version</B> are equally valid section-names within an INF file. </P>

<P>This section describes the INF file sections in the same order that they generally appear in most device INF files. However, these sections actually can be specified in any arbitrary order. The Setup code finds all sections within each INF file by section name, not by sequential order, whether system-defined or INF-writer-defined. 

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="inf-format_2fzm.htm"><B>Version</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>This is a required section for every INF file. For installation on Windows&nbsp;2000 and later, and/or Windows&nbsp;9x/Me platforms, this section must have a valid <B>Signature</B> entry. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_0icy.htm"><B>SourceDisksNames</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>This section is required if the INF file has a corresponding <B>SourceDisksFiles</B> section. This section is required to install IHV/OEM-supplied devices and their drivers from distribution media included in packaged products. It is also required in such an INF file that installs either of the following:

<UL>
	<LI>A co-installer DLL to supplement the operations of a system-supplied device class installer or co-installers (see also <I>DDInstall</I><B>.CoInstallers</B> later in this list)</LI>

	<LI>A new class installer DLL to supplement the operations of the OS's device installer (see also <B>ClassInstall32</B> later in this list) </LI>
</UL>


<P>This section identifies the individual source distribution disks or CD-ROM discs for the installation. By contrast, the system-supplied INF files each specify a <B>LayoutFile</B> entry in their <B>Version</B> sections and provide at least one other INF file detailing the source distribution contents and layout of all software components to be installed. 
</DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_4836.htm"><B>SourceDisksFiles</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>This section identifies the locations of files to be installed from the distribution media to the destinations on the target machine. An INF file that has this section must also have a <B>SourceDisksNames</B> section. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_6p9u.htm"><B>ClassInstall32</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>This section initializes a device setup class. It is required in any class installer INF file. INF files that install devices and their drivers under any system-defined device class do not need this section. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_04mq.htm"><B>ClassInstall32.Services</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>INF files commonly use the <B>ClassInstall32.Services</B> section with at least one <B>AddService</B> directive to control how and when the services of a particular device class are loaded, any dependencies it might have on other services, and so forth.</DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_8kfm.htm"><B>DestinationDirs</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>Device/driver INF files have a <B>DestinationDirs</B> section to specify a default destination directory for INF-specified copies of the files supplied on the distribution media or listed in the INF layout files. This section is required unless the INF file installs a device, such as a modem or display monitor, that has no files except its INF to be installed with it. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_15o2.htm"><B>ControlFlags</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>This section controls whether the Add Hardware Wizard presents a list of INF-specified <I>Models</I> values from which the end user selects a particular manually installed device (or model of a device) to be installed from the INF file. It also can control whether an INF file is used only to transfer files from the distribution media. 

<P>In general, most INF files for device drivers and for the system class installers have this section so they can exclude at least a subset of <I>Models</I> entries from the list of manually installable devices to be displayed to end users. INF files that only install PnP devices suppress the display of all model-specific information. 
</DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_816a.htm"><B>Manufacturer</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>This section is required in INF files for devices and their drivers. 

<P>The <B>Manufacturer</B> section of a system device class INF is sometimes called a "Table of Contents," because each of its entries references an INF-writer-defined <I>Models</I> section, which, in turn, references additional INF-writer-defined sections, such as a per-models-entry <I>DDInstall</I> section, <I>DDInstall</I><B>.Services</B> section, and so forth. 
</DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_3ywi.htm"><I>Models</I> Section</A> (per <B>Manufacturer</B> entry) </DT>

<DD>This section is required to identify the devices for which the INF file installs drivers. It specifies a set of mappings between the generic name (string) for a device, the device ID, and the name of the <I>DDInstall</I> section, elsewhere in the INF file, containing the installation instructions for the device.

<P>An INF file that installs one or more devices and drivers for a single provider would have only one <I>Models</I> section, but system INF files for device classes can have many INF-writer-defined <I>Models</I> sections.
</DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_2k8i.htm"><I>DDInstall</I> Section</A> (per <I>Models</I> entry) </DT>

<DD>This section is required to actually install any devices listed in a <I>Models</I> section in the INF file, along with the drivers for each such device. A <I>DDInstall</I> section can be shared by more than one <I>Models</I> section.</DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_6nle.htm"><I>DDInstall</I><B>.Services</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>This section is required as an expansion of the <I>DDInstall</I> section for most Windows&nbsp;2000 and later kernel-mode device drivers, including any WDM drivers (exceptions are INF files for modems and display monitors). It controls how and when the services of a particular driver are started, its dependencies (if any) on underlying legacy drivers, and so forth. This section also sets up event-logging services by a device driver if it supports event logging. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_5k6q.htm"><I>DDInstall</I><B>.HW</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>This optional section adds device-specific (and typically, driver-independent) information to the registry or removes such information from the registry, possibly for a multifunction device or to install one or more PnP filter drivers. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_65bm.htm"><I>DDInstall</I><B>.CoInstallers</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>This optional section registers one or more device-specific co-installers supplied on the distribution media to supplement the operations of the system's device installer or of an existing device class installer. 

<P>A co-installer is an IHV/OEM-provided Win32® DLL that typically writes additional configuration information to the registry or performs other installation tasks that require dynamically generated, machine-specific information that is not available when the device's INF file is created. For more information, see <A HREF="coinst_5p0n.htm">Writing a Co-installer</A>. 
</DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_7dgy.htm"><I>DDInstall</I><B>.FactDef</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>This section should be included in the INF file of any manually installed nonPnP device. It specifies the factory default hardware configuration settings, such as the bus-relative I/O ports, IRQ (if any), and so forth, for the card.</DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_03qq.htm"><I>DDInstall</I><B>.LogConfigOverride</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>This section is used to create an <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">override configuration</A>, which overrides the hardware resource requirements that a Plug and Play device's bus driver reports.</DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_4eeq.htm"><I>DDInstall</I><B>.Interfaces</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>If a driver exports the functionality of a device interface class, thus creating a new instance of the interface class, such as kernel-streaming still-image capture or data decompression, its INF file can have this section. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_3o8i.htm"><B>InterfaceInstall32</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>If a to-be-installed component, such as a new class driver, provides one or more new <A HREF="setup-cls_54kn.htm">device interface classes</A> to higher-level components, its INF file has this section. In effect, this section bootstraps a set of device interfaces for a new class by setting up whatever is needed to make use of the functionality that the interface class provides. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_33ea.htm"><B>DefaultInstall</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>An INF file's <B>DefaultInstall</B> section will be accessed if a user selects the "Install" menu item after right-clicking on the INF file name.</DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_0yr6.htm"><B>DefaultInstall</B>.<B>Services</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>This section is equivalent to the <A HREF="inf-format_6nle.htm">INF <I>DDInstall</I><B>.Services</B> section</A>, and is used in association with an <A HREF="inf-format_33ea.htm">INF <B>DefaultInstall</B> section</A>.</DD>

<DT><A HREF="inf-format_3uuq.htm"><B>Strings</B> Section</A> </DT>

<DD>This section is required in every INF file to define each <B>%</B><I>strkey</I><B>%</B> token specified in the INF. By convention, the <B>Strings</B> section (or sections if the INF provides a set of locale-specific <B>Strings</B> sections) appears last in all system-supplied INF files for ease of maintenance and localization. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>Some of the sections listed here, particularly those with <I>Install</I> in their names, can contain directives that reference additional INF-writer-defined sections. Each directive causes particular operations to be carried out on the items listed under the appropriate type of INF-writer-defined section during the installation process. </P>

<P>The set of valid entries and directives for any particular section in the preceding list is section-specific and shown in the formal syntax of the reference for each of these sections. Additionally, see <A HREF="create-inf_904n.htm">Summary of INF Directives</A> for a summary of the most commonly used directives.</P>

<P>Optional entries and directives within each such section are shown enclosed in unbolded brackets, as for example:</P>

<P><B>[Version]</B><BR>
 ...<BR>
[<B>Provider=%</B><I>INF-creator</I><B>%</B>] <BR>
 ...</P>

<P>The <B>Provider</B> entry in a <B>[Version]</B> section is optional in the sense that it is not a mandatory entry in every INF file. </P>
