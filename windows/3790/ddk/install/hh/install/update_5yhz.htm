<P>Drivers are updated when a user runs the Hardware Update Wizard. Following is a set of guidelines to follow when writing installation software and INF files that update existing drivers.

<UL>
	<LI>Installation software can call <A HREF="di-rtns_01ki.htm"><B>UpdateDriverForPlugAndPlayDevices</B></A>, supplying an INF file and a hardware ID, to update drivers for devices that match the hardware ID. For more information, see <A HREF="custom-install_7n53.htm">Writing a Device Installation Application</A>.</LI>

	<LI>When upgrading a driver, class installers and co-installers should not supply finish-install pages in response to <A HREF="dif-codes_2msy.htm">DIF_NEWDEVICEWIZARD_FINISHINSTALL</A> unless absolutely necessary. If possible, obtain finish-install information from the settings of the previous installation.</LI>

	<LI>To the extent possible, class installers and co-installers should avoid basing behavior on whether they are providing an initial installation or are updating drivers for an already-installed device.</LI>

	<LI>For Windows XP and later, the registry values <B>CoInstallers32</B> and <B>EnumPropPages32</B> are deleted prior to delivery of <A HREF="dif-codes_33ea.htm">DIF_REGISTER_COINSTALLERS</A>. INF files for earlier OS versions must explicitly either delete these values or perform a non-appending modify operation on them.</LI>

	<LI>For Windows XP and later, the registry values <B>UpperFilters</B> and <B>LowerFilters </B>are deleted prior to delivery of <A HREF="dif-codes_7d9u.htm">DIF_INSTALLDEVICE</A>. INF files for earlier OS versions must explicitly either delete these values or perform a non-appending modify operation on them.</LI>

	<LI>Do <I>not</I> use <A HREF="inf-format_3vg2.htm">INF <B>DelFiles</B> directives</A> or <A HREF="inf-format_0pki.htm">INF <B>RenFiles</B> directives</A> when updating drivers. Setup cannot guarantee that a particular file is not being used by another device. (Class installers and co-installers can delete or rename files, <I>if</I> they can reliably determine that no devices are using the files.)  </LI>

	<LI>Use the <A HREF="inf-format_21de.htm">INF <B>DelReg</B> directive</A> to remove old device-specific registry entries from a previous installation of the device, if the entries are no longer needed. (Do not remove global registry entries.)</LI>

	<LI>Do <I>not</I> use the <A HREF="inf-format_91iq.htm">INF <B>DelService</B> directive</A> in an <A HREF="inf-format_6nle.htm">INF <I>DDInstall</I><B>.Services</B> section</A> to remove previously installed device/driver services from the target machine. Setup cannot guarantee that a particular service is not being used by another device. (Class installers and co-installers can delete services, <I>if</I> they can reliably determine that no devices are using the services.)</LI>

	<LI>When updating a class installer, class co-installer, or service DLL, you must give the new version a new file name.</LI>
