<P>The problem could be bad hardware, or a new driver might be needed. Devices stay in this state if they have been prepared for removal. This error code can be set if a driver's <B>DriverEntry</B> routine detects a device but the <B>DriverEntry</B> routine later fails. (For Windows XP and later, <B>DriverEntry</B> problems have separate error codes.)</P>

<H4>Display Message – Windows 98/Me</H4>
