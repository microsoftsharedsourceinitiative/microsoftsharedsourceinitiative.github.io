<P>This document guides you through the planning and decision-making process involved in developing a Windows device driver, starting with design and continuing through distribution. </P>

<P>Given the wide variation among devices and the intricate nature of driver operations, no single driver design or development plan can cover every possible technology. However, any driver development project will proceed more smoothly and efficiently if you: 

<UL>
	<LI>Follow industry standards for hardware and drivers</LI>

	<LI>Understand important operating system and driver concepts</LI>

	<LI>Decide early in the design process which operating system platforms to support</LI>

	<LI>Test for device and driver compatibility with all Windows operating systems you plan to support </LI>

	<LI>Use up-to-date driver development, debugging, and testing tools </LI>
</UL>

<P>This guide is intended for programmers who are new to Windows driver development. It assumes that you know C and might have written a driver for other operating systems (including MS-DOS®, Windows® 95, or Windows NT® 4.0 and earlier), but have not written a driver for Windows&nbsp;2000 or later, or for Windows 98/Me.</P>

<P>The following sections provide further introductory material:</P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="gs_intro_031j.htm">Steps in Driver Development</A> </P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="gs_intro_1qav.htm">Additional Resources for Driver Writers</A> </P>

<P>Because the purpose of most drivers is to operate a physical device, this guide is aimed at those writing such drivers. If you're writing a file system driver or file system filter, see the <I>Installable File System Kit</I> (IFS Kit). You can order the IFS Kit through the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=8706&clcid=0x409" target="_blank">Microsoft IFS Kit</A> Web site. </P>
