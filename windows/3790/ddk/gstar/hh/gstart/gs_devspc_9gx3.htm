<P>Drivers for most standard types of devices ship with the operating system. These drivers include bus drivers for the most common buses, port and host controller drivers, class drivers, and file system drivers. </P>

<P>In addition, the Windows DDK provides sample drivers and documentation for a wide variety of devices, and documents interfaces for common buses so that, if necessary, you can write a driver for a device of a new type. </P>

<P>To determine what type of driver your device requires, and whether such a driver is already present, consult the technology-specific information contained in this DDK documentation. Use the DDK viewer's table of contents, index, and search capability to locate information about driver support for your device type. If your device is a multifunction device, you should also see <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">Supporting Multifunction Devices</A>.</P>

<P>If a class driver is available for your device type, you probably do not need to write a complete driver, but instead only a minidriver that provides device-specific support and works with the class driver.</P>

<P>The system-supplied class drivers are designed to hide bus-specific requirements from minidrivers. For example, the mouse class driver <I>mouclass.sys</I> interfaces with the HID class driver for USB mice, and with the I8042 port driver for PS/2 mice. As a result, supporting a new type of mouse on either of these buses is fairly straightforward. Similarly, the storage class drivers work with the storage port driver, isolating bus-related details from device-specific storage miniport drivers. </P>

<P>If a class driver is not available for your device type, or if the available class drivers do not support the bus or port to which your device attaches, your device probably requires a new driver. The driver should include both the "top-end" device-specific functionality and the "bottom-end" functionality to communicate with the next-lower driver (usually a bus or port driver). For suggestions on how to streamline the development process, see <A HREF="gs_design_2mav.htm">Driver Design and Implementation Strategies</A>.</P>

<P>Do not attempt to replace the system-supplied bus drivers. </P>
