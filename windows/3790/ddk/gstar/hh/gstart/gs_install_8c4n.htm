<P>A co-installer is a user-mode Win32 DLL. Typically, a co-installer performs installation tasks that require dynamic information that is not available when the INF for its device or device class is written. For example, a co-installer is typically used when the user must supply information for device-specific settings through a property page.</P>

<P>A co-installer can perform installation operations for one particular device or for all the devices in a setup class. 

<UL>
	<LI>A <I>device co-installer</I> handles custom installation requirements for a specific device or family of devices. For example, a hypothetical <I>xyzcam.dll</I> device co-installer could support all the still-image cameras that are shipped by the <I>Xyz </I>Company. </LI>

	<LI>A <I>class co-installer</I> performs identical actions for every device in its class. For example, a hypothetical <I>image.dll</I> co-installer could support all the possible devices of the imaging class, such as still-image capture devices, digital cameras (including that of the <I>Xyz </I>Company), and scanners.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Microsoft supplies class co-installers for classes that require them; third parties seldom do. Do not supply a class co-installer with your device unless you can guarantee that every device in its setup class requires the actions of your class co-installer.</P>

<P>On the other hand, vendors often supply device co-installers. You should write a device co-installer if you need to display property pages or custom Finish pages during device or driver installation. </P>

<P>For more information, see <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">Writing a Co-Installer</A> and <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_2.Click()">Providing Device Property Pages</A>. </P>

<P>If your co-installer displays a custom Finish page or other user interface elements, make sure that those elements conform to the user interface guidelines that are described in the MSDN® Library and the Wizard 97 section of the Platform SDK. </P>
