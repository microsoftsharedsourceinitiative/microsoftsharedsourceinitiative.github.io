<P>Microsoft's Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) tests drivers for compliance with the requirements of the "Designed for Windows" Logo Program for hardware. Through this program, device manufacturers can license the Windows Logo for use on product packaging, advertising, and other marketing materials for all systems and components that pass compliance testing.</P>

<P>Hardware and drivers must pass WHQL testing to receive a "Designed for Windows" logo, to receive a digital signature, to be included on the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL), and to be distributed as part of the <A HREF="gs_sign_4eef.htm">Windows Update</A> program. For additional details, see <A HREF="gs_sign_9bon.htm">WHQL Digital Signatures</A>.</P>

<P>"Designed for Windows" Logo Program requirements vary depending on the type of device. Requirements for each device type are available on the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=8772&clcid=0x409" target="_blank">Windows Logo Program for Hardware</A> Web site. </P>

<P>For most device types, WHQL provides a test kit that you can download. Details vary by device type; for current information, kits, and download instructions, see the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=8705&clcid=0x409" target="_blank">Windows Hardware Quality Labs</A> Web site.</P>
