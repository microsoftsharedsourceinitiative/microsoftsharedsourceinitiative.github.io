<P>The IRP is submitted to the lower driver though the <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()"><B>IoCallDriver</B></A> routine. The <I>avc.sys</I> driver attempts to guarantee that an AV/C request is made, and at least an interim response received within the span of this call. The following table of return codes describe how the request was handled.</P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=37%>Return code</TH>
<TH align=left width=63%>Description</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=37%>STATUS_SUCCESS</TD>
<TD width=63%>The request was made, and a final response received within the bounds of the timeout and retry parameters. The AV/C response code must still be examined to determine the true result of the operation (STATUS_SUCCESS simply means that a round-trip request/response cycle was completed).</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=37%>STATUS_TIMEOUT</TD>
<TD width=63%>The request was made, but no response was received before all timeout and retry processing was complete. The target device ignores requests if a previous request is still being processed. Some AV/C devices are noncompliant, and refuse to respond within the 100ms timeout, even after several successive attempts. The AVC_COMMAND_IRB structure permits the adjustment of the default <B>Timeout</B><I> </I>and <B>Retries </B>members (100ms and 9, respectively), but these default settings have been sufficient for all known implementations.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=37%>STATUS_PENDING</TD>
<TD width=63%>The request was made, and an interim response was received. It is the responsibility of the completion routine to handle the final response and free the IRP and IRB resources.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=37%>STATUS_REQUEST_ABORTED</TD>
<TD width=63%>When submitting AV/C requests, immediately abort when the IRP completion status is STATUS_REQUEST_ABORTED.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=37%>STATUS_*</TD>
<TD width=63%>Any other return code indicates that an error occurred that was beyond the scope of the AV/C protocol.</TD>
