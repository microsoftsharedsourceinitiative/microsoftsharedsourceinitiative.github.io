<P>The AV/C Streaming filter driver (<I>avcstrm.sys</I>) is installed as a lower level filter driver to subunit drivers to provide streaming services. The interface to this service is based on the I/O request packet (IRP) model used by the WDM architecture with a list of supported I/O control (IOCTL) functions. It can service a subunit driver that is based on either the stream class driver model (Kernel Streaming 1.0) or the new AVStream class driver model (Kernel Streaming 2.0). The following diagram illustrates AV/C subunit drivers that use the AV/C stream filter driver. The AVStream driver model is the preferred interface to use.</P>

<P><I>Avcstrm.sys</I> is format aware. It must know the format of the streaming data, such as SDDV or MPEG2TS, in order to make the proper isochronous connection between the source and the target devices. With the given format information, it can then interface with the AV/C subunit's driver through the 61883 protocol driver to receive or transmit data. Because <I>avcstrm.sys</I> is format aware, it will have to be updated to add a different format (for example a service pack or new OS release). Currently, SDDV and MPEG2TS formats are the only formats implemented.</P>

<P>In the future, <I>avcstrm.sys</I> may be extended to:

<UL>
	<LI>Query data format</LI>

	<LI>Perform data intersection (negotiate data format between two pins)</LI>

	<LI>Be a clock provider</LI>

	<LI>Get and set streaming properties</LI>
</UL>

<P>Currently, each subunit driver must implement the preceding operations.</P>

<P>The AV/C Streaming filter driver does not timestamp data at this time. A clock provider needs to timestamp the data as well as provide the current stream time. If a subunit driver is a clock provider, it needs to implement this functionality. The subunit driver must timestamp the data if it is to be a clock provider.</P>
