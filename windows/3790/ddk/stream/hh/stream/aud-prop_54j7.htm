<P>The <B>KnownFiles</B> directive provides explicit control over whether to improve or degrade the ranking of a driver. The change in driver ranking is conditional and takes effect only if the existing driver installation contains one or more known driver files. This directive is supported only by Windows&nbsp;98/Me and is specific to the installation of media-class device drivers.</P>

<P>The <B>KnownFiles</B> directive appears in the <I>DDInstall</I> section of an INF file, but because Windows&nbsp;2000 and later do not support this directive, it is not listed in the <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">INF <I>DDInstall </I>Section</A> reference page.</P>

<P>The directive has the following format:</P>

<P class=indent1><B>KnownFiles</B> <B>=</B> <I>known-files-section</I> </P>

<P>The directive specifies the name of a <I>known-files-section</I>, which contains a list of known driver files and specifies whether the driver's ranking should be raised or lowered if any of those files are already installed. The general format for a <I>known-files-section</I> is shown in the following:</P>

<P class=indent1><B>[</B><I>known-files-section</I><B>]</B><BR>
<I>known-filename</I> <B>=</B> <B>force</B> | <B>keep</B> | <B>safe</B><BR>
<I>known-filename2</I> <B>=</B> <B>force</B> | <B>keep</B> | <B>safe</B><BR>
...</P>

<P>Each of the directives in the section specifies the name of a known file and one of the following keywords: <B>force</B>, <B>keep</B>, or <B>safe</B>. The keyword takes effect only if the media-class installer finds the named file among the system's existing (previously installed) drivers. The three keywords and their meanings are shown in the following table.</P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=18%>Keyword</TH>
<TH align=left width=82%>Meaning</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=18%><B>force</B></TD>
<TD width=82%>Improve the driver's ranking. This is likely to force installation of the driver, in which case it replaces the previously installed driver.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=18%><B>keep</B></TD>
<TD width=82%>Degrade the driver's ranking. This increases the likelihood that the system will keep the previously installed driver.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=18%><B>safe</B></TD>
<TD width=82%>The driver is safe to install. This keyword does not directly modify the driver's ranking, but it does lessen the negative impact of any warnings on the driver's ranking.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>The effect of the <B>force</B> and <B>keep</B> keywords is to modify the driver's ranking. The <B>Setup</B> API assigns an initial ranking number to each driver and sorts the drivers into several ranges of ranking numbers (see <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_2.Click()">How Setup Selects Drivers</A>):

<UL>
	<LI>Range 0 to 0xFFF (hardware ID matches)</LI>

	<LI>Range 0x1000 to 0x1FFF (compatible ID matches)</LI>

	<LI>Range 0x2000 to 0x2FFF (and so on)</LI>
</UL>

<P>The media-class installer can then modify the initial rankings, based on factors such as directives in a <I>known-files-section</I>. The change in ranking number due to the <B>force</B> or <B>keep</B> keyword is a small fraction of a range, and the initial driver ranking is biased toward the center of the range.</P>

<P>A driver with a smaller ranking number is preferable to a driver with a larger ranking number. For example, the <B>Setup</B> API chooses a driver in the top range (0 to 0xFFF) over one in the second range (0x1000 to 0x1FFF). Note that the <B>force</B>, <B>keep</B>, and <B>safe</B> keywords have no effect over this choice when the two drivers fall into different ranges.</P>

<H4>Example</H4>

<P>The following example is a fragment of an INF file that checks the system for known driver files <I>aaa.sys </I>and <I>bbb.sys </I>during installation:</P>

<PRE>  KnownFiles = XYZ.KnownFiles
  ...
  [XYZ.KnownFiles]
  aaa.sys = keep
  bbb.sys = force</PRE>

<P>If the system already contains a file named <I>aaa.sys </I>from a previous installation, the installer will keep the existing version of that file instead of replacing it with a new version of the file. However, if the system already contains a file named <I>bbb.sys </I>from a previous installation, the installer will do one of the following: 

<UL>
	<LI>Replace the existing version of <I>bbb.sys </I>with a new version of <I>bbb.sys </I>if one is available.</LI>

	<LI>Simply delete the existing version of <I>bbb.sys </I>if the INF file does not provide a new version of the file.</LI>
</UL>
