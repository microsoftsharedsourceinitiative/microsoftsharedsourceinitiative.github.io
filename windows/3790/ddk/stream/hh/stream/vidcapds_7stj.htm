<P>Breaking apart the TV/radio tuner(s), crossbar, video capture, and TV audio components into separate filters results in the need to provide a means to correctly describe the topological connections between components. Medium GUIDs (Mediums) are used to describe a hardware connection, and this value is used by graph builders to construct graphs.</P>

<P>Mediums are exposed by the <A HREF="ks-struct_735f.htm">KSPIN_MEDIUM</A> structure, which consists of a GUID-type member (<B>Set</B>) followed by two ULONG members (<B>Id</B> and <B>Flags</B>). The <B>Set</B> member should be assigned a unique GUID representing a hardware connection. The <B>Id</B> member should be set to an instance value, and the <B>Flags</B> member should be set to zero. This allows installation of multiple instances of the same hardware.</P>

<P>Since TV/radio tuner, TV audio and crossbar minidrivers do not actually create kernel streaming pins for their inputs and outputs, these drivers need to call a special function to register themselves with DirectShow to allow for automatic graph building. The function used for this purpose is <A HREF="strclass-routines_8tdf.htm"><B>StreamClassRegisterFilterWithNoKSPins</B></A>.</P>

<P>When deriving a new minidriver from sample code in the Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp; DDK, it is important to remember to generate new GUID values for the Mediums that reflect the unique topology presented by the minidriver. Failure to do so can result in the Mediums for one device colliding with the Mediums defined for another device.</P>
