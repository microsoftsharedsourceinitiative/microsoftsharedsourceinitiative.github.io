<P>The following is a list of classes of miniport driver interfaces:</P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="pcdesign_7c13.htm">WaveCyclic Miniport</A> </P>

<P class=indent2>Supports access to DMA-based wave I/O functions of ISA and other audio cards. The interface specifically addresses cyclic (<I>autoinit</I>) DMA buffers; it ignores streaming issues.</P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="pcdesign_37dz.htm">PCI Scatter/Gather Miniport</A> </P>

<P class=indent2>Supports access to wave audio functions such as the wave I/O functions of a PCI audio card. In this model, lists of wave audio buffers are logically appended to create a stream of wave audio.</P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="pcdesign_6ilj.htm">Topology Miniport</A> </P>

<P class=indent2>Supports access to the various controls (volume, equalization, and reverb) that audio adapters typically include. This interface is focused on enumerating components (known as <I>nodes</I>) in the topology, discovering their interconnections, and reading and writing control parameters.</P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="pcdesign_0xev.htm">MIDI Miniport</A> </P>

<P class=indent2>Supports access to simple MIDI-hardware devices such as FM synthesizers. This class of driver is served by the MIDI port driver, but timing is handled by the port driver. The miniport driver is only responsible for the delivery of MIDI bytes. MIDI devices that handle their own timing are supported by a different class of miniport driver, which is served by the DMus port driver (see immediately below).</P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="pcdesign_8o87.htm">Advanced MIDI DLS Miniport</A> </P>

<P class=indent2>Supports more advanced hardware and software MIDI devices such as wavetable synthesizers. This class of miniport drivers is served by the DMus port driver, which provides high performance for devices such as MPU-401. Timing can be handled by either the miniport driver or the port driver. In addition to MIDI playback and recording, the miniport driver supports downloadable sounds (DLS). This miniport class also supports software synthesis.</P>
