<P>The AV/C Streaming  filter driver (a<I>vcstrm.sys</I>) provides easy-to-integrate services to stream various media signals to its client AV/C subunit driver. Since this filter driver services only AV/C subunits and provides format aware streaming services, it is called the AV/C Streaming (<I>avcstrm.sys</I>) filter driver.</P>

<P>The services the optional AV/C Streaming filter driver provides help stream the media signal (data) from an AV/C subunit if that signal is in either SDDV or MPEG2TS formats. These formats are the two most common methods of storing the digital data in the media signal.</P>

<P>The tape subunit specifications by the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=8728&clcid=0x409" target="_blank">1394 Trade Association</A> Web site support different transport state controls such as play, pause, record and stop, regardless of its media signal. However, the media signal for the same subunit type may be different or it may be the same. Both DV and DVHS contain tape subunits. However, DV uses the SDDV media signal based on the IEC 61883-2 specifications, and DVHS uses the MPEG2TS media signal based on the 61883-4 specifications. </P>

<P>Therefore a tape subunit filter driver must then support both SDDV and MPEG2TS media signals but use the same device control for the tape subunit. This implies that every subunit driver would have to duplicate the same program functionality to provide such format aware streaming capability. Consequently, Microsoft provides this filter driver for the subunit driver stack to provide such service to various subunit drivers of the same or different subunit type.</P>

<P>Programming an AV/C subunit driver on the Microsoft 61883 and AV/C subunit driver stacks requires driver functions to receive or transmit data streams using device driver interfaces (DDIs) provided by the 61883 protocol driver. These driver functions perform the following operations:

<UL>
	<LI>Allocate isochronous resources and make an isochronous connection</LI>

	<LI>Queue data buffers</LI>

	<LI>Attach and complete receiving or transmitting data buffers</LI>

	<LI>Synchronize stream state across threads</LI>
</UL>
