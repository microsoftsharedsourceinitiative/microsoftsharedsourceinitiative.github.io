<H4>Members</H4>

<DL>
<DT><B>ExtendedHeaderSize</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the size of this structure, in bytes.</DD>

<DT><B>dwFrameFlags</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies flags indicating additional information about the frame captured. During capture, the minidriver sets this member to one of the following values that are defined in <I>ksmedia.h</I>:

<DL>
<DT>KS_VIDEO_FLAG_FRAME</DT>

<DD>Indicates a complete frame.</DD>

<DT>KS_VIDEO_FLAG_FIELD1</DT>

<DD>Indicates Field 1 of a two-field sequence.</DD>

<DT>KS_VIDEO_FLAG_FIELD2</DT>

<DD>Indicates Field 2 of a two-field sequence.</DD>

<DT>KS_VIDEO_FLAG_I_FRAME</DT>

<DD>Indicates that this frame can be completely decoded without reference to any other frames.</DD>

<DT>KS_VIDEO_FLAG_P_FRAME</DT>

<DD>Indicates that this is a predicted frame.</DD>

<DT>KS_VIDEO_FLAG_B_FRAME</DT>

<DD>Indicates that this is a bidirectional frame.</DD>
</DL>
</DD>

<DT><B>PictureNumber</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies a count representing the current picture number. The counter is reset to zero when the stream is placed in the run state. </DD>

<DT><B>DropCount</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of pictures that were not captured. During capture, the minidriver sets this member. This counter should be incremented whenever a frame should have been captured but was not; this condition usually arises when no buffers were available during capture. </DD>

<DT><B>hDirectDraw</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the user-mode handle to DirectDraw. This handle is only provided to the minidriver when capturing to a DirectDraw surface for preview or overlay purposes.</DD>

<DT><B>hSurfaceHandle</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the user-mode handle to the DirectDraw surface. This handle is only provided to the minidriver when capturing to a DirectDraw surface for preview or overlay purposes.</DD>

<DT><B>DirectDrawRect</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the portion of the DirectDraw surface that has been locked. This is normally the entire surface.</DD>

<DT><B>Reserved1</B></DT>

<DD>Reserved and should not be used by the minidriver.</DD>

<DT><B>Reserved2</B></DT>

<DD>Reserved and should not be used by the minidriver.</DD>

<DT><B>Reserved3</B></DT>

<DD>Reserved and should not be used by the minidriver.</DD>

<DT><B>Reserved4</B></DT>

<DD>Reserved and should not be used by the minidriver.

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>The KS_FRAME_INFO structure provides a way to return information about the frame captured, as well as a way to pass Microsoft® DirectDraw® handles used when capturing to a DirectDraw surface.</P>

<P>The <B>PictureNumber</B> member count represents the count of the current picture, which is calculated in one of two ways depending on the device:

<UL>
	<LI>Measure the time since the stream was started and divide by the frame duration. This method is appropriate for devices that do not provide their own clock. For example: <I>PictureNumber = ElapsedTime / FrameDuration</I></LI>

	<LI>Add together the count of frames captured and the count of frame dropped. This method is appropriate for devices that provide their own clock. For example: <I>PictureNumber = FramesCaptured + FramesDroppe</I>d</LI>
</UL>

<P>When calculating <B>PictureNumber</B> and <B>DropCount</B>, it is important to use the frame duration specified when the stream was opened, which may not necessarily match the rate at which the device is actually producing images. For example, a USB camera may only produce images at 7.5 fps, but a client could open the stream at 8 fps. In this case, all calculations should use the 8 fps number. </P>
