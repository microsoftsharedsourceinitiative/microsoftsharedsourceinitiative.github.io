<P>VBI decoders must be immediately informed of tuning changes. For example, as the tuner switches from channel 3 to channel 4, a VBI decoder must be notified at the beginning of the tuning operation so it can temporarily stop decoding during the period of signal instability. When the tuning operation completes, the VBI decoder must then be notified of the new channel and any video standard or country/region code changes that may have occurred.</P>

<P>The tuning packet is propagated from the tuner filter, through the crossbar filter, then into the analog video input pin on the capture filter. This packet is only available in user mode until it reaches the capture filter. The capture minidriver receives this tuning packet as a <A HREF="vidcapref_57ar.htm">KS_TVTUNER_CHANGE_INFO</A> structure on the analog video input pin.</P>

<P>The tuning packet must be propagated to any VBI output pins using the extended header (see <A HREF="vidcapds_6isn.htm">Video Stream Extended Headers</A>). VBI decoders that operate as a chain must similarly propagate the extended header information from their input pins to their output pins.</P>
