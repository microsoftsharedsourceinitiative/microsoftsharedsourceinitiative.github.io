<P>A slightly more complex graph is created for a conferencing camera that exposes a “still” pin. This still pin can provide a higher resolution image when the user pushes a button on the camera.</P>

<P>Microsoft provides a minidriver library for USB cameras (USBCAMD) that supports cameras with still pins. For information about USBCAMD, see <A HREF="usbcmdds_2p0n.htm">USB Camera Minidrivers</A> and <A HREF="usbcmdpr_2tyr.htm">USB Camera Minidriver Library</A>.</P>

<P><B>USB Video Camera Filter Graph</B></P>

<P>Here, the still pin streams only a single image when the user pushes the button on the camera. Alternatively, the still pin can be triggered by programmatic control.</P>

<P>The Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) technology built upon the Still Image Architecture (STI) complements the functionality provided by USBCAMD. See <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">Windows Image Acquisition Drivers</A> and <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_2.Click()">Still Image Drivers</A> for more information.</P>

<P>The WIA Video Snapshot filter is an addition to WIA that shipped with Windows XP and later operating systems. It is a filter driver that enables still frames to be captured from the video stream.</P>

<P>There are two methods of capturing a still from the device. The first is to insert the WIA Video Snapshot filter downstream from the capture filter and trigger a capture programmatically. The second is to enable still pin support using the USBCAMD model. The WIA Video Snapshot filter can then be triggered by pushing a button on the device.</P>

<P>The advantage of capturing an image from the still pin as opposed to the video stream is that the still pin can provide a higher resolution image in addition to permitting the user to capture an image by pressing a button on the device.</P>

<P>Driver writers can add still pin support to their minidrivers if they want to enable users to trigger captures via a hardware button on device and/or the device can capture higher resolution still. If support isn't explicitly added, the WIA Video Snapshot filter can be software triggered, but the resolution will be the same resolution as the video stream.</P>

<P>Some still pin implementations can only be rendered after the capture pin because they are based on the capture pin data formats.</P>
