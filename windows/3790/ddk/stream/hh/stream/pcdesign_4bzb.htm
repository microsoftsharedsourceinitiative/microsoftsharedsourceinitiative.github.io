<P>The DMus port driver provides DirectMusic® functionality. The adapter driver provides a corresponding DMus miniport (see <A HREF="pcdesign_8o87.htm">Advanced MIDI DLS Miniport</A>) driver object that binds itself to the DMus port driver object to form a DirectMusic filter (see <A HREF="aud-design_6wx3.htm">MIDI and DirectMusic Filters</A>) that can capture or play back a MIDI stream. The port and miniport driver objects communicate with each other through their respective <A HREF="audmp-routines_7pgz.htm"><B>IPortDMus</B></A> and <A HREF="audmp-routines_4vjn.htm"><B>IMiniportDMus</B></A> interfaces.</P>

<P>By using a layered approach, the vendor can write an adapter driver that operates on one of several levels, depending on the adapter's hardware functionality. When determining the level of support that a given hardware function requires, the vendor should first determine whether a built-in miniport driver already exists that supports the function (see the <A HREF="audpc-routines_4dyr.htm"><B>PcNewMiniport</B></A> function's list of built-in miniport drivers). If not, the vendor must implement a proprietary miniport driver but might still be able to use one of the built-in port drivers (see the <A HREF="audpc-routines_58s3.htm"><B>PcNewPort</B></A> function's list of built-in port drivers).</P>

<P>To implement WDM support for a device, follow these steps:

<OL>
	<LI>If a built-in miniport driver already supports the hardware function, use the existing miniport driver to manage the function.</LI>

	<LI>If the hardware function is not compatible with a built-in miniport driver, then determine whether the function is compatible with at least one of the built-in port drivers. If a built-in port driver supports the hardware function, write the portion of the miniport driver that manages the function. That miniport driver should comply with the specification for the miniport interface that the owning port driver expects.</LI>

	<LI>If no built-in port driver supports the hardware function, write a miniport driver to support the function. The miniport driver should comply with the interface specification for the streaming-class driver.</LI>
</OL>
