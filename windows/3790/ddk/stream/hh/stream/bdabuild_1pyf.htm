<P>You can use the DirectShow Filter Graph Editor (Graphedt.exe) to insert a DirectShow filter instance of your BDA component in a filter graph so that you can test your component. You can obtain the Graph Editor from the DDK. </P>

<P>You can use the Graph Editor to perform rudimentary tests of a BDA component, such as, connecting pins that are exposed by a filter instance of the component to other pins of filter types in the graph. </P>

<P>To use the Graph Editor to thoroughly test functionality of your BDA component, you must build a filter graph that starts with a BDA network provider filter, contains a filter instance of your BDA component, and is rendered, at least, through a demultiplexer filter (packet identifier (PID) filter) to a transport information filter (TIF). The biggest problem with using the Graph Editor is that there is no dedicated application to submit requests via the <B>ITuner</B> interface that the network provider filter implements. However, the network provider filter has associated property pages that provide some limited ability to exercise the <B>ITuner</B> interface. </P>
