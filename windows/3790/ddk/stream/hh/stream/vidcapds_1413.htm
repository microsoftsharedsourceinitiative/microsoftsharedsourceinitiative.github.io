<P>To ensure orderly resource allocation, only a subset of the possible kernel streaming state transitions is allowed. The following table lists the allowed transitions along with tasks that the driver typically will perform:</P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=21%>Transition</TH>
<TH align=left width=79%>Description</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>Stop to Pause</TD>
<TD width=79%>Allocate resources. The read SRBs typically are queued after the transition to the Pause state has completed.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>Pause to Run</TD>
<TD width=79%>Begin streaming.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>Run to Pause</TD>
<TD width=79%>Stop streaming. The outstanding read SRBs remain in the driver-maintained queue.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>Pause to Stop</TD>
<TD width=79%>Deallocate resources and complete all outstanding read SRBs. SRBs that have not been filled with an image are completed with zero length in the <B>DataUsed</B> member of the <A HREF="ks-struct_7l4j.htm">KSSTREAM<B>_</B>HEADER</A> structure.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>Note that the transitions can cycle multiple times between the Pause and Run state before returning to the Stop state. Drivers should expect transitions such as:</P>

<P class=indent1>stop -&gt; acquire -&gt; pause -&gt; run -&gt; pause -&gt; run -&gt; pause -&gt; stop</P>

<P>When a stream is in the Stopped state, it must immediately complete all outstanding data-read SRBs.</P>

<P>Since a user-mode application can terminate unexpectedly while streaming, all capture drivers must accept the <A HREF="strclass-srbs_8egj.htm">SRB_CLOSE_STREAM</A> request at any time. Under these conditions, all outstanding buffers are canceled by the stream class driver through the cancel routine immediately before the SRB_CLOSE_STREAM is received. Note that the stream state  cannot be set to the stopped state before the termination.</P>
