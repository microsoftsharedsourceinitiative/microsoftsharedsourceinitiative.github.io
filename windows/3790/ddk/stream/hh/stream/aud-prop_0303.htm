<P>The KSAUDIO_POSITION structure specifies the current positions of the read and write cursors in the sound buffer for an audio stream. This structure is used to <I>get</I> and <I>set</I> the data value for the <A HREF="aud-prop_8aer.htm">KSPROPERTY_AUDIO_POSITION</A> property.</P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>During playback, the play and write offsets are interpreted as follows:

<UL>
	<LI><B>PlayOffset</B> is the offset of the last byte in the buffer that has played. <B>PlayOffset</B> + 1 is the offset of the next byte that will play.</LI>

	<LI><B>WriteOffset</B> is the offset of the last byte in the playback buffer.</LI>
</UL>

<P>When an application submits another buffer to the device for playback, <B>WriteOffset</B> will increment upon receipt of that buffer to indicate the new <B>WriteOffset</B> value, but <B>PlayOffset</B> does not change until after that buffer has actually been played by the device.</P>

<P>During recording, the play and write offsets are interpreted as follows:

<UL>
	<LI><B>PlayOffset</B> is the offset of the last byte in the buffer that has been captured. <B>PlayOffset</B> + 1 is the offset of the next byte that will be captured.</LI>

	<LI><B>WriteOffset</B> is the offset of the last byte in the capture buffer.</LI>
</UL>

<P>When an application submits another buffer to the device for capturing, the <B>WriteOffset</B> value will increment upon receipt of that buffer. The <B>PlayOffset</B> value will not change until data has actually been captured into the buffer.</P>

<P>The space between <B>PlayOffset</B> and <B>WriteOffset</B> is considered off-limits to the application because this represents buffers that have already been sent to the driver.</P>

<P>Note that <B>PlayOffset</B> and <B>WriteOffset</B> are not offsets into any one physical buffer that either your driver has allocated or an application has allocated. Instead, these offsets are stream-relative and can be thought of as offsets into an idealized buffer that contains the entire stream and is contiguous from beginning to end. Any internal offsets that point into the actual physical buffers that contain the data need to be maintained separately.</P>

<P>DirectSound uses this property to implement the <B>IDirectSoundBuffer::GetCurrentPosition</B> and <B>IDirectSoundBuffer::SetCurrentPosition</B> methods, which are described in the Platform SDK documentation.</P>
