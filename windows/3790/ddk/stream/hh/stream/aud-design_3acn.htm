<P>Wave-format tag 0x0092 is defined as AC3-over-S/PDIF. Tags 0x0240 and 0x0241 are synonymous with 0x0092 and many DVD applications treat the three tags as identical. To eliminate redundancy, however, drivers and applications should support only tag 0x0092 (and not support tags 0x0240 and 0x0241).</P>

<P>When AC3 data passes over an S/PDIF link in digital form without being decoded, it can be treated the same as a two-channel, 16-bit, 48-kHz PCM stream. In fact, when specifying an AC3-over-S/PDIF data range, the wave-format tag itself is the only thing that differs from a data range of PCM data being output through the S/PDIF port.</P>

<P>AC3 data is streamed in units called frames. Each frame can be independently decoded into 1536 samples of PCM audio (multiplied by the number of channels in the frame). This represents 32 milliseconds of audio at a 48-kHz sample rate. A 5.1-channel AC3 frame occupies fewer bytes than 1536 stereo PCM samples. (There are exceptions to this, but those types of AC3 frames are very uncommon, cannot be transmitted over S/PDIF, and can be ignored here.) In order to avoid delivering the compressed audio bitstream over the S/PDIF interface faster than real time (that is, to prevent delivery of 32 milliseconds of audio in less than 32 milliseconds), an AC3 frame must be padded with zeros until it takes up the same number of bytes as 1536 stereo PCM samples.</P>

<P>If you attempt to send unpadded AC3 to a PortCls adapter driver that uses WaveCyclic, be aware that when the port driver senses data starvation (because the data stream contains fewer bytes than a two-channel uncompressed stream would), it fills the cyclic buffer with silence. The AC3 decoder is likely to have problems interpreting these periods of silence, which are in PCM rather than AC3 format.</P>

<P>If you are passing AC3 through an S/PDIF port to a decoder, you should indicate that the stream is in a non-PCM format by setting the /AUDIO bit on the S/PDIF transceiver. The decoder reads this bit from the S/PDIF channel-status block to determine whether the data stream is encoded in a non-PCM format.</P>
