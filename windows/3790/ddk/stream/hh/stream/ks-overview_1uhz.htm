<P>A <I>property</I> represents a capability or control-state setting that belongs to a kernel streaming object, such as a filter or pin. Clients of a kernel streaming minidriver can send get and set property requests (KSPROPERTY_TYPE_GET and KSPROPERTY_TYPE_SET) to the filters and pins that the minidriver has instantiated. A group of related properties is referred to as a <I>property set</I>.</P>

<P>To get or set individual properties, clients call the Win32 function <B>DeviceIoControl</B> with the <I>dwIoControlCode</I> parameter set to IOCTL_KS_PROPERTY. The input buffer is either a <A HREF="ks-struct_6jlf.htm">KSPROPERTY</A> structure or a wrapper containing a KSPROPERTY structure and other information relevant to the request. In response to this call, the operating system dispatches an IRP to the class driver.</P>

<P>When the class driver receives the resulting IRP, it calls <A HREF="ksfunc_7sqb.htm"><B>KsPropertyHandler</B></A>. The class driver includes as a call parameter the address of the KSPROPERTY structure that identifies the specifics of the property request. The property request is either handled automatically at the class driver level or by a minidriver-provided handler. See <A HREF="ks-prop_3f03.htm">Kernel Streaming Property Sets</A> for reference information including which property sets are handled by the class driver and which require minidriver-provided handlers. A minidriver can override or augment the class driver handler by providing callbacks for a property that is by default handled by the class driver.</P>

<P>If the minidriver has provided handlers for this property, <B>KsPropertyHandler</B> in turn hands off the request to the appropriate minidriver-supplied callback.</P>

<P>A minidriver provides pointers to its property support callbacks in a structure of type <A HREF="ks-struct_2iwj.htm">KSPROPERTY_ITEM</A>. A minidriver groups an array of related KSPROPERTY_ITEM structures in a <A HREF="ks-struct_2rsj.htm">KSPROPERTY_SET</A> structure. Different class driver models have slightly different methods for the minidriver to make property set data available to the class driver. You can find class driver-specific information by following the links in <A HREF="ks-overview_9vdz.htm">Kernel Streaming</A>.</P>

<P>The minidriver also provides a pointer to a <A HREF="ks-struct_5mwj.htm">KSPROPERTY_VALUES</A> structure in a KSPROPERTY_ITEM structure. The KSPROPERTY_VALUES structure in turn contains an array of <A HREF="ks-struct_9kfn.htm">KSPROPERTY_MEMBERSLIST</A> structures. This is where the minidriver specifies the size and type of acceptable values for the property. Each KSPROPERTY_MEMBERSLIST structure contains a header member: see <A HREF="ks-struct_7qr7.htm">KSPROPERTY_MEMBERSHEADER</A> for information on how to specify legal ranges or values for a property that your minidriver supports. You can also find an implementation of this mechanism in the <I>Testcap</I> sample in the DDK.</P>

<P>To report the size and type of acceptable values for a property, the class driver returns a <A HREF="ks-struct_9wab.htm">KSPROPERTY_DESCRIPTION</A> structure in response to a KSPROPERTY_TYPE_BASICSUPPORT request from the client.</P>

<P>The class driver may append a list of KSPROPERTY_MEMBERSHEADER structures to the KSPROPERTY_DESCRIPTION structure.</P>
