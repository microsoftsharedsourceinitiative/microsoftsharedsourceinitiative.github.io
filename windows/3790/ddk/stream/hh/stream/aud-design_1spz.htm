<P>The KsStudio utility (<I>ksstudio.exe</I>) is included with the software tools in the Windows DDK. KsStudio is a kernel streaming tool that can be used to build, examine, and test WDM KS filter graphs in Windows&nbsp;98/Me, and in Windows&nbsp;2000 and later. One of KsStudio's most useful features is its ability to construct a graphical representation of a filter graph that shows both the pin-to-pin connections between filters and the filters' internal nodes. Although KsStudio is designed primarily for audio filter graphs, it can be used to build and explore graphs containing any type of WDM KS filter.</P>

<P>An earlier version of KsStudio, which is named Grapher (<I>grapher.exe</I>), is included in the Windows&nbsp;2000 and Windows&nbsp;Me DDKs.</P>

<P>For more information, see the help file for the KsStudio utility in the Windows DDK.</P>
