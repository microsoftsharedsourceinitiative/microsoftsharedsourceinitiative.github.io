<P>The filter provides a description of its topology nodes in the form of an array of node descriptors (<A HREF="audpc-struct_973n.htm">PCNODE_DESCRIPTOR</A> structures). Each descriptor in the array describes a single node and contains a GUID that specifies the node type (for example, <A HREF="aud-prop_5g37.htm">KSNODETYPE_REVERB</A>). For a list of the standard node types that are defined for audio devices, see <A HREF="aud-prop_24z7.htm">Audio Topology Nodes</A>.</P>

<P>The filter identifies each of its nodes by the node's index in the descriptor array. For example, when sending a node-specific property request to a filter or to a particular pin on a filter, a client includes the node ID (the array index) in the request in order to identify the target node.</P>

<P>The filter provides a description of its internal connections in the form of an array of connection descriptors (<A HREF="audpc-struct_6yb7.htm">PCCONNECTION_DESCRIPTOR</A> structures). Each descriptor describes one of the filter's internal connections. A descriptor can describe a connection between a pin and a node, a connection between two nodes, or a pass-through pin-to-pin connection.</P>

<P>The nodes and connections that the filter exposes together define the filter's internal topology. The topology is a map of the audio device's internal layout and should accurately reflect the organization of the hardware that it represents. The Windows Multimedia <B>mixer</B> API, for example, translates the filter's internal connections into mixer lines and its nodes into controls on the mixer lines (see <A HREF="pcdesign_8nqf.htm">Kernel Streaming Topology to Audio Mixer API Translation</A>). Any inaccuracies in the filter's internal topology are reflected in the mixer-line representation and may cause errors or unexpected behavior in an application that uses the <B>mixer</B> API.</P>
