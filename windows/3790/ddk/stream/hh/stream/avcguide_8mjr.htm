<P>If AV/C target functionality is enabled, <I>avc.sys</I> supports only SUBUNIT_INFO (0x31) and UNIT_INFO (0x30) opcodes directly. These opcodes are described in the <I>AV/C Digital Interface Command Set General Specification, Rev 3.0</I>.</P>

<P>In order to support additional unit commands, such as those for CCM or DTCP, <I>avc.sys</I> provides a "plug-in" extension mechanism. Any number of subunit or WDM filter drivers can register the unit opcodes they support through the <B>AlternateOpcodes </B>member of the <A HREF="avcref_2tv7.htm">AVC_COMMAND_IRB</A> submitted through the <A HREF="avcref_4xir.htm">AVC_FUNCTION_GET_REQUEST</A> function. <B>AlternateOpcodes</B> is a counted byte array, with element 0 being the number of alternate opcodes in the remaining bytes. <B>AlternateOpcodes</B> is ignored when sending a response, so there is no need to hide the alternate opcodes when processing a unit request.</P>

<P>To use the built-in extension mechanism, specify the unit address (0xff) in the <B>SubunitAddress</B> member of the AVC_COMMAND_IRB structure. The <B>SubunitAddress</B> member is left alone in the case of unit commands (which means that the unit address you provide will still be there). The virtual subunit driver always is able to key off of the <B>SubunitAddress</B> member.</P>
