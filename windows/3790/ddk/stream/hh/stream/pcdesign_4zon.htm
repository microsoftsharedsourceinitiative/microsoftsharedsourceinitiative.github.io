<P>Hardware vendors occasionally provide proprietary speaker-configuration utilities to be used with their audio drivers in place of the speaker dialog in Control Panel. Such utilities have a potential problem: they sometimes change the speaker configuration in a proprietary way that fails to notify Windows of the change. This can result in a bad user experience if the settings in the proprietary utility do not match those in Control Panel. If you believe that your device requires a proprietary utility, you should take the following steps to integrate your utility with Windows:

<OL>
	<LI>Implement a DAC node in your driver that supports the <A HREF="aud-prop_4aib.htm">KSPROPERTY_AUDIO_CHANNEL_CONFIG</A> property. Through this node, Windows informs the driver immediately of changes made by the user in Control Panel.</LI>

	<LI>Your configuration utility should call the DirectSound methods <B>GetSpeakerConfig</B> and <B>SetSpeakerConfig</B> to manage the speaker configuration.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The <B>SetSpeakerConfig</B> call informs DirectSound (and Windows) of changes that your utility makes to the speaker configuration. Also, your utility's initialization code should call <B>GetSpeakerConfig</B> to determine if the user has changed any settings through Control Panel. If so, the utility should reflect these changes in its user interface.</P>

<P>If your device supports multichannel formats that have no precise Windows equivalents, your configuration utility should do the following:

<UL>
	<LI>When changing to a speaker configuration that has no precise Windows equivalent, call <B>SetSpeakerConfig</B> with the closest Windows equivalent. This is in addition to making any proprietary calls that are needed to configure the driver.</LI>

	<LI>When changing to a speaker configuration that <I>does</I> have a precise Windows equivalent, call <B>SetSpeakerConfig</B> to update the speaker mode.</LI>
</UL>

<P>If you make Windows more aware of your device's capabilities, DirectSound can enable some features that it could not otherwise enable (for example, multichannel 3D panning).</P>
