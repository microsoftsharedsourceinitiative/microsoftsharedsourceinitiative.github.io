<P>DirectShow and kernel streaming both utilize time stamps to synchronize multiple data streams. Time is measured in 100 nanosecond (ns) units. Kernel-mode clocks begin counting time when they first transition out of the stopped state. Thereafter, time increases monotonically until the stream again transitions to the stopped state.</P>

<P>Each data packet transferred corresponds to a single frame or field of video or ancillary data. Capture drivers concerned with frame-accurate video capture can choose to provide a clock that all other filters can use as a reference. Digital video minidrivers are an example of minidrivers that should provide graph clocks. Alternatively, capture minidrivers that run asynchronously to other multimedia streams, such as USB and 1394 conferencing cameras, should time stamp their packets using a clock provided by another component, such as an audio digitizer.</P>

<P>Capture minidrivers indicate that they are able to provide a master clock by setting the following values in the <A HREF="strclass-struct_4wc3.htm">HW_STREAM_OBJECT</A>:</P>

<PRE>PHW_STREAM_OBJECT *pStreamObject;
 
PStreamObject-&gt;HWClockFunction = (PHW_CLOCK_FUNCTION)StreamClockRtn;
 
PStreamObject-&gt;ClockSupportFlags =
    CLOCK_SUPPORT_CAN_READ_ONBOARD_CLOCK |
    CLOCK_SUPPORT_CAN_RETURN_STREAM_TIME;</PRE>
