<P>On Windows&nbsp;98 and Windows&nbsp;2000, DirectSound does not support non-PCM formats, regardless of the DirectSound version. (However, DirectSound&nbsp;8 does support non-PCM formats on both Windows&nbsp;98&nbsp;SE + QFE and Windows&nbsp;2000 SP2. Also, the versions of DirectSound that ship with Windows&nbsp;Me, and Windows&nbsp;XP and later, support non-PCM formats.)</P>

<P>To determine whether a WDM driver supports a particular wave format, a client can attempt to create a DSBCAPS_LOCHARDWARE buffer in that format on the driver and see if the attempt succeeds. The DirectSound API provides no other way to discover which non-PCM data formats are supported.</P>

<P>DirectSound allows secondary DSBCAPS_LOCHARDWARE buffers to have any valid <A HREF="aud-prop_5s4z.htm">WAVEFORMATEX</A> or <A HREF="aud-prop_7wz7.htm">WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE</A> format that the selected driver supports. When searching for the format in the driver's list of supported formats, DirectSound checks only for formats that contain the KSDATAFORMAT_SPECIFIER_DSOUND specifier.</P>

<P>You can extend a DirectSound application to use a non-PCM format by first creating a WAVEFORMATEX or WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE structure that describes the format. Next, load a pointer to the structure into the <I>lpwfxFormat</I> member of the DSBUFFERDESC structure that is passed to the <B>CreateSoundBuffer</B> method. No other changes to existing DirectSound code are required in order to use a non-PCM format. Note that the controls that a driver typically supports for PCM data are unlikely to be supported for some non-PCM formats. For example, a card that supports digital output of AC3-encoded data is unlikely to support the DSBCAPS_CTRLPAN or DSBCAPS_CTRLVOLUME controls on that data, so attempting to create the DirectSound buffer with those flags can fail.</P>

<P>DirectSound playback through VxD drivers or legacy <B>waveOut</B> drivers is still limited to PCM; non-PCM formats are not supported.</P>
