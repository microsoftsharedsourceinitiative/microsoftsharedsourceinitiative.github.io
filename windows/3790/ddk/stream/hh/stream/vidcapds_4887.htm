<P>Video capture minidrivers can support multiple, simultaneous streams of compressed and uncompressed video, timecode, closed caption, raw and decoded VBI data, and custom data formats. For each data type that can be produced simultaneously with other data types, the minidriver should create a new stream. Each stream is exposed as a separate kernel streaming pin by the stream class driver. These pins are mirrored by the DirectShow capture filter. For more information on pins and streaming, see <A HREF="ks-overview_9vdz.htm">Kernel Streaming</A>.</P>

<P>Video streams are composed of time-stamped, digitized video and related information such as VBI and timecode. Streams can be paused, started, and stopped independently of one another. Stream samples are time stamped with a 100-nanosecond resolution clock. </P>

<P>Each video streaming pin can support a variety of different formats. For example, a single pin could support RGB16, RGB24, YUV9, and JPEG digital video. Most devices will support only a few of these pins. More information about stream formats and format ranges is provided in <A HREF="vidcapds_8hbb.htm">Video Stream Formats</A>.</P>

<P>Streaming conventions are also applied to input pins on the capture filter that represents analog video flowing into the capture device, and to video port output connections for both images and VBI.</P>
