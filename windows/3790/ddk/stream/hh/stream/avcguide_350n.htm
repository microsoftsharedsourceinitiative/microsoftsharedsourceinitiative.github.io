<P>The peer stack can include support for AV/C target functionality. In the context of the peer stack, target functionality is limited to the support of AV/C unit commands. Subunit drivers can perform this function, but for devices with multiple subunits, a WDM filter driver is the preferred method. The computer is only exposed as an AV/C target if an upper driver (subunit or filter driver) registers to receive incoming requests (through <A HREF="avcref_4xir.htm">AVC_FUNCTION_GET_REQUEST</A>). For more information about AV/C unit commands, see <A HREF="avcref_8xir.htm">AVC_FUNCTION</A>.</P>

<P>When enabled as an AV/C target, <I>avc.sys</I> provides implementations of UNIT_INFO and SUBUNIT_INFO commands. For more information, see <A HREF="avcguide_8mjr.htm">The Unit Command Extension Driver</A>.</P>

<P>Driver loading is based on device IDs, therefore unit functionality may be loaded selectively on a device or vendor-specific basis. The virtual stack supports this mechanism generically (not in a device-specific way). For more information, see <A HREF="avcguide_2so7.htm">Peer Subunit Enumeration</A> and <A HREF="avcguide_29bb.htm">Virtual Device Stack</A>.</P>

<P>Through this peer stack extension mechanism, third party vendors can independently implement value-add features such as 5C, as well as extensions to the AV/C implementation provided by Microsoft.</P>
