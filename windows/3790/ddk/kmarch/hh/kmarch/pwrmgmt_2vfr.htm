<P>When a bus driver handles an PnP <A HREF="pnp-irps_1gqa.htm">IRP_MN_START_DEVICE</A> request for one of its child devices, it should power on the device and call <A HREF="portn_5saa.htm"><B>PoSetPowerState</B></A> to report the device state to the Power Manager. Powering on the device is an implicit part of device start-up. The device power policy owner does not send an IRP_MN_SET_POWER request for <B>PowerDeviceD0</B>, so drivers should not expect to receive these IRPs at start-up. </P>

<P>When a device has been powered down to conserve power, its drivers should power it up when an I/O request arrives. In this case, the device power policy owner must send an IRP_MN_SET_POWER to return the device to the working state. When the IRP completes, the drivers for the device stop queuing I/O and begin to process requests off the queue.</P>
