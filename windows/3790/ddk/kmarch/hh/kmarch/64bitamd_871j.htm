<P>One of the constraints for the AMD64 compiler is to have no inline assembler support. This means that functions that cannot be written in C or C++ must be written either as subroutines or as intrinsic functions that are supported by the compiler. Certain functions are performance-sensitive while others are not. Performance-sensitive functions should be implemented as intrinsic functions. In general, this will be the same list of intrinsic functions implemented for ALPHA and the IA64, but will include AMD64-specific functions as well.</P>

<P>The intrinsic functions that are supported by the compiler are described in the <A HREF="64bitamd_0ron.htm">Intrinsic Functions for AMD64</A> section.</P>
