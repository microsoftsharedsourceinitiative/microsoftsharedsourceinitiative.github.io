<P>The size of the kernel-mode stack is limited to approximately three pages. Consequently, when passing data to internal routines, drivers cannot pass large amounts of data on the kernel stack. </P>

<P>To avoid running out of kernel-mode stack space, use the following design guidelines:

<UL>
	<LI>Avoid making deeply nested calls from one internal driver routine to another, if each routine passes data on the kernel stack. </LI>

	<LI>Take care to limit the number of recursive calls that can occur, if you design a driver with a recursive routine. </LI>
</UL>

<P>In other words, the call-tree structure of a driver should be relatively flat. You can call the <A HREF="k104_7foy.htm"><B>IoGetStackLimits</B></A> and <A HREF="k104_8wmq.htm"><B>IoGetRemainingStackSize</B></A> routines to determine the amount of kernel stack space that is available. Note that the size of the kernel-mode stack can vary among different hardware platforms and different versions of the operating system.</P>

<P>Running out of kernel stack space causes a fatal system error. Therefore, it is better for a driver to <A HREF="memmgmt_9mef.htm">allocate a system-space buffer</A> than to run out of kernel stack space. However, nonpaged pool is also a limited system resource. </P>

<P>Drivers of devices that use DMA can buffer data to be transferred, if necessary, either by calling <A HREF="k102_2omq.htm"><B>ExAllocatePoolWithTag</B></A> for a <B>NonPagedPool</B>-type buffer or, for some drivers, by using common-buffer DMA. For more information, see <A HREF="iputoput_8gmf.htm">Using Common-Buffer System DMA</A> and <A HREF="iputoput_34tj.htm">Using Common-Buffer Bus-Master DMA</A>.</P>
