<P>All PnP drivers must be prepared to receive power IRPs with minor IRP code <A HREF="poirp_44fm.htm">IRP_MN_WAIT_WAKE</A>. How a driver handles a wait/wake IRP depends on its position in the device stack, the type of device(s) it controls, and the specific states from which its device supports wake-up.</P>

<P>The following sections provide guidelines for handling this IRP based on the type of driver and its level of wait/wake support.</P>
