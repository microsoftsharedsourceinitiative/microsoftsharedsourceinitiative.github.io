<P>To use GUIDs in a kernel-mode driver, you must do two things:

<OL>
	<LI>Include the <I>initguid.h</I> header file that redefines the <B>DEFINE_GUID</B> macro.
<P>The <I>initguid.h</I> header file redefines the <B>DEFINE_GUID</B> macro to instantiate GUIDs (versus just declaring an EXTERN reference). Include this header file in the driver source file where the GUIDs should be instantiated. (User-mode applications include &lt;<I>objbase.h</I>&gt; before including header files containing GUID definitions.)
</LI>

	<LI>Include the header file(s) that define the GUIDs.
<P>After the statement to include <I>initguid.h</I>, you include the header files containing the GUID definitions. A driver might include more than one header file that contains GUID definitions, including system-supplied header files and third-party header files.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>The following code excerpt shows the sequence of statements for including GUIDs:</P>

<PRE>:
// include system headers here such as wdm.h
 
#include &lt;initguid.h&gt;
 
// include system and driver-specific header files here that contain
// GUID definitions
 
:</PRE>

<P>Put the above statements in one module of the driver; typically the main module. When the above statements are present, the driver refers to a GUID using its symbolic name.</P>
