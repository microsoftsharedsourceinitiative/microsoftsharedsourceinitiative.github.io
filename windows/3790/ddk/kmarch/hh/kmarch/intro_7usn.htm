<P>The following figure shows the major internal components of the NT-based operating system.</P>

<P><B>NT Component Overview</B></P>

<P>The NT-based operating system includes some components that run in user mode and others that run in kernel mode. File system, intermediate, and lowest-level drivers are shown at the lower left, included with the kernel-mode I/O Manager. </P>

<P>As this figure shows, the operating system includes a number of kernel-mode components with well-defined functionality isolated in each component. Those of most interest to kernel-mode driver writers are the Kernel, I/O Manager, Plug and Play Manager, Power Manager, Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), Configuration Manager, Memory Manager, Executive Support, and Process Structure components. Additional components of interest to some driver writers include the Object Manager and Security Reference Monitor. </P>
