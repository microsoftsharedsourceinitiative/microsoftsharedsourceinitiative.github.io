<H4>Members</H4>

<DL>
<DT><B>Guid</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the GUID that represents the block to register or update.</DD>

<DT><B>Flags</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates characteristics of the block to register or update. 

<P>If a block is being registered with static instance names, a driver sets one of the following flags:


<DL>
<DT>WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_LIST </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the driver provides static instance names for this block in a static list following the WMIREGINFO structure in the buffer at <B>IrpStack-&gt;Parameters.WMI.Buffer</B>. If this flag is set, <B>InstanceNameList</B> is the offset in bytes from the beginning of the WMIREGINFO structure that contains this WMIREGGUID to a contiguous series of <B>InstanceCount</B> counted UNICODE strings.</DD>

<DT>WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_BASENAME  </DT>

<DD>Requests WMI to generate static instance names from a base name provided by the driver following the WMIREGINFO structure in the buffer at <B>IrpStack-&gt;Parameters.WMI.Buffer</B>. WMI generates instance names by appending a counter to the base name. If this flag is set, <B>BaseNameOffset</B> is the offset in bytes from the beginning of the WMIREGINFO structure that contains this WMIREGGUID to a single counted UNICODE string that serves as the base name.</DD>

<DT>WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO</DT>

<DD>Requests WMI to generate static instance names from the device instance ID for the PDO. If this flag is set, <B>InstanceInfo</B> points to the PDO passed to the driver's AddDevice routine. WMI generates instance names from the device instance path of the PDO. Using the device instance path as a base for static instance names is efficient because such names are guaranteed to be unique. WMI automatically supplies a "friendly" name for the instance as an item in a data block that can be queried by data consumers. </DD>
</DL>


<P>If a block is being registered with dynamic instance names, WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_LIST, WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_BASENAME, and WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO must be clear.


<P>A driver might also set one or more of the following flags:


<DL>
<DT>WMIREG_FLAG_EVENT_ONLY_GUID</DT>

<DD>The block can be enabled or disabled as an event only, and cannot be queried or set. If this flag is clear, the block can also be queried or set. </DD>

<DT>WMIREG_FLAG_EXPENSIVE</DT>

<DD>Requests WMI to send an IRP_MN_ENABLE_COLLECTION request the first time a data consumer opens the data block and an IRP_MN_DISABLE_COLLECTION request when the last data consumer closes the data block. This is recommended if collecting such data affects performance, because a driver need not collect the data until a data consumer explicitly requests it by opening the block. </DD>

<DT>WMIREG_FLAG_REMOVE_GUID</DT>

<DD>Requests WMI to remove support for this block. This flag is valid only in response to a request to update registration information (<A HREF="k901_4omq.htm">IRP_MN_REGINFO</A> or <A HREF="k901_9d4i.htm">IRP_MN_REGINFO_EX</A> with <B>Parameters.WMI.DataPath </B>set to WMIUPDATE).</DD>

<DT>WMIREG_FLAG_TRACED_GUID</DT>

<DD>The block can be written only to a log file and can be accessed only through user-mode routines declared in <I>evntrace.h</I>. Only NT kernel-mode data providers set this flag.</DD>

<DT>WMIREG_FLAG_TRACE_CONTROL_GUID </DT>

<DD>The GUID acts as the control GUID for enabling or disabling the trace GUIDs associated with it in the MOF file. This flag is valid only if WMIREG_FLAG_TRACED_GUID is also set. Only NT kernel-mode data providers set this flag. </DD>
</DL>
</DD>

<DT><B>InstanceCount</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of static instance names to be defined for this block. If the block is being registered with dynamic instance names, WMI ignores <B>InstanceCount</B>.</DD>

<DT><B>InstanceNameList</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the offset in bytes from the beginning of the WMIREGINFO structure that contains this WMIREGGUID to a contiguous series of <B>InstanceCount</B> counted Unicode strings. This member is valid only if WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_LIST is set in <B>Flags</B>. If the block is being registered with dynamic instance names, WMI ignores <B>InstanceNameList</B>. </DD>

<DT><B>BaseNameOffset</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the offset in bytes from the beginning of the WMIREGINFO structure that contains this WMIREGGUID to a single counted UNICODE string that serves as a base for WMI to generate static instance names. This member is valid only if WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_BASENAME is set in <B>Flags</B>. If the block is being registered with dynamic instance names, WMI ignores <B>BaseNameOffset</B>. </DD>

<DT><B>Pdo</B></DT>

<DD>Pointer to the physical device object (PDO) passed to the driver's AddDevice routine. WMI uses the device instance path of this PDO as a base from which to generate static instance names. This member is valid only if WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO is set in <B>Flags</B>. If the block is being registered with dynamic instance names, WMI ignores <B>Pdo</B>. </DD>

<DT><B>InstanceInfo</B></DT>

<DD>Reserved for use by WMI.

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>A driver builds one or more WMIREGGUID structures in response to an <A HREF="k901_4omq.htm">IRP_MN_REGINFO</A> or <A HREF="k901_9d4i.htm">IRP_MN_REGINFO_EX</A> request to register or update its blocks. The driver passes an array of such structures at the <B>WmiRegGuid </B>member of a WMIREGINFO structure, which the driver writes to the buffer at <B>IrpStack-&gt;Parameters.WMI.Buffer</B>.</P>

<P>A driver can register or update a block with either static or dynamic instance names. Static instance names provide best performance; however, dynamic instance names are preferred for data blocks if the number of instances or instance names change frequently. For more information about instance names, see <A HREF="wmi_5ijr.htm">Defining WMI Instance Names</A>.</P>
