<P>As the <A HREF="drvcomps_6js7.htm#ddk__bmc_24drvobj.wmf__kg">Driver Object</A> figure shows, kernel-mode drivers have other standard routines along with those for which they set entry points in their respective driver objects. Most standard driver routines and some of the configuration-dependent objects they use are defined by the I/O Manager. The ISR, <I>SynchCritSection</I> routine, and those shown in the Driver Object figure with names containing the word "custom" are defined by the NT Kernel.</P>

<P>Most drivers use the device extension of each device object they create to maintain device-specific state about their I/O operations and to store pointers to any system resources that they must allocate in order to have other standard routines. For example, the <B>DDCustomTimerDpc</B> routine shown in the Driver Object figure requires the driver to supply storage for Kernel-defined timer and DPC objects.</P>

<P>The set of standard driver routines for lowest-level drivers shown on the left in the Driver Object figure is necessarily different from the set for higher-level drivers. Some of the routines shown in this figure are device-dependent or configuration-dependent requirements. Others are optional: you may choose to implement such a routine depending on the nature or configuration of the driver's devices, on the driver's design, and on the driver's position in a chain of layered drivers.</P>
