<P>The <B>DeviceWake</B> field contains the lowest (least-powered) device power state from which the device can signal a wake event, or <B>PowerDeviceUnspecified</B> if the device cannot wake in response to an external signal. </P>

<P>The bus driver sets this value. A higher-level driver can change the value to a higher-powered state. For example, if the bus driver sets <B>DeviceWake</B> to D3 but a driver further up the device stack supports wake-up only from D2, the higher-level driver can change the value to D2. </P>

<P>Note that if a driver changes <B>DeviceWake</B>, it might also have to change <A HREF="pwrmgmt_4exz.htm"><B>SystemWake</B></A> to avoid conflicts with the system-to-device mappings in the <B>DeviceState</B> array. For example, assume that the bus driver sets the following:

<UL>
	<LI><B>DeviceState[PowerSystemSleeping1]</B> = <B>PowerDeviceD1</B></LI>

	<LI><B>DeviceState[PowerSystemSleeping2]</B> = <B>PowerDeviceD3</B></LI>

	<LI><B>DeviceWake</B> = <B>PowerDeviceD3</B></LI>

	<LI><B>SystemWake</B> = <B>PowerSystemSleeping2</B></LI>
</UL>

<P>If a higher-level driver determines that its device cannot wake the system from D3, but only from D2 or higher, it can change <B>DeviceWake</B> to D2. However, this change causes the mapping from S2 to D3 to be impossible. Remember that the <B>DeviceState</B> array lists the highest-powered state a device can support for a given system state. If the system state in the example is <B>PowerSystemSleeping2</B>, the device state cannot be <B>PowerDeviceD2</B>. To eliminate this problem, the driver must also change <B>SystemWake</B> to <B>PowerSystemSleeping1</B>. The same is true for the <B>WakeFromD<I>x</I></B> and <B>DeviceD<I>x</I></B> settings. A driver must ensure that any changes it makes to <B>SystemWake</B> or <B>DeviceWake</B> do not conflict with the <B>WakeFromD</B><I>x</I> and <B>DeviceD</B><I>x</I> values. The values of <B>WakeFromD</B><I>x</I> and<B> DeviceD</B><I>x</I><B> </B>reflect hardware characteristics that a driver cannot change.</P>

<P>If both the <B>SystemWake</B> and <B>DeviceWake</B> fields are nonzero (that is, not <B>PowerSystemUnspecified</B>), then the device and its drivers support wake-up on this system.</P>

<P>On non-ACPI hardware, the <B>DeviceWake</B> field contains zero (<B>PowerSystemUnspecified</B>). </P>
