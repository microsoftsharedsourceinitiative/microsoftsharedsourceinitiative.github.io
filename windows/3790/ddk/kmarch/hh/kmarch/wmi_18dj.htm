<P>To publish a WMI schema, a driver writer first creates a text file in Managed Object Format (MOF) language that contains a class definition for each data block and event block in the schema, as described in <A HREF="wmi_7qnb.htm">MOF Syntax for WMI Data and Event Blocks</A>.</P>

<P>A driver writer can then publish a driver's WMI schema in one of the following ways:

<OL>
	<LI>Compile the MOF file and include it as a resource in the driver's binary image. For more information, see <A HREF="wmi_5xrb.htm">Compiling a Driver's MOF File</A>.</LI>

	<LI>Include the compiled MOF file as a resource in a different file, such as a DLL, and add the registry value <B>MofImagePath</B> with a path to the file that contains the MOF under the driver's Service key. A schema published in this way can be updated without recompiling the driver. For more information, see <A HREF="wmi_24kn.htm">Setting the <B>MofImagePath</B> Registry Key</A>.</LI>

	<LI>Include binary data within the driver and return it when WMI requests it. A schema published in this way can be changed dynamically at runtime. For more information, see <A HREF="wmi_6ylj.htm">Implementing Dynamic MOF Data</A>.</LI>
