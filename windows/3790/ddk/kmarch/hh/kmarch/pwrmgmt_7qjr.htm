<P>In its <A HREF="drvrrtns_4d6a.htm"><I>AddDevice</I></A> routine, each driver creates a device object (filter DO, FDO, or PDO) and sets DO_<I>Xxxx</I> flags as required. The following device object flags pertain to power management:

<UL>
	<LI>DO_POWER_INRUSH</LI>

	<LI>DO_POWER_PAGABLE</LI>
</UL>

<P>The device object flags are typically set by the bus driver when it creates the PDO for the device. However, some function drivers might need to alter the values of these flags as part of their <I>AddDevice</I> routines. In general, the values of the flags should be consistent throughout all the device objects in the entire device stack.</P>

<P>On Windows&nbsp;2000 and later systems, drivers of devices that are in the paging path must not set the DO_POWER_PAGABLE flag. Drivers that do not set the flag must be callable at IRQL&nbsp;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.</P>

<P>In general, drivers should not alter the bus driver's value for this flag, and a driver must never set the flag if a lower-level driver has cleared it. When handling transitions involving <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">PnP paging requests</A> (typically in response to an IRP_MJ_PNP with IRP_MN_DEVICE_USAGE_NOTIFICATION request), a storage driver must carefully sequence its setting and clearing of the flag. </P>

<P>Windows&nbsp;2000 and later drivers that can be paged must set the DO_POWER_PAGABLE flag. The Power Manager calls such drivers at IRQL&nbsp;= PASSIVE_LEVEL. All WDM and Windows 98/Me drivers must set DO_POWER_PAGABLE. In addition, Windows 98/Me drivers must not complete power IRPs at IRQL&nbsp;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. </P>

<P>Drivers for devices that require an inrush of power at start-up must set the DO_POWER_INRUSH flag in the device object before clearing the DO_DEVICE_INITIALIZING flag. Only one driver in the stack, typically the bus driver (PDO), needs to set DO_POWER_INRUSH. The flag notifies the Power Manager that such devices must be powered up one at a time, in sequence with other such devices. The Power Manager ensures that only one power inrush IRP is active anywhere in the system at any given time. </P>

<P>The Power Manager can send inrush IRPs at IRQL&nbsp;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. While handling an inrush IRP, a driver must not access any pageable code or data.</P>

<P>Drivers cannot set both DO_POWER_PAGABLE and DO_POWER_INRUSH flags.</P>
