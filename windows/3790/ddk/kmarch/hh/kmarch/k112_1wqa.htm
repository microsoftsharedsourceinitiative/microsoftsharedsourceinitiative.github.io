<H1><A NAME="ddk_pnp_device_state_dr"></A>PNP_DEVICE_STATE</H1>

<P>The PNP_DEVICE_STATE structure contains a bitmask of flags that describe the PnP state of a device. Drivers return this structure in response to an IRP_MN_QUERY_PNP_DEVICE_STATE IRP.</P>

<PRE class=syntax>typedef ULONG PNP_DEVICE_STATE, *PPNP_DEVICE_STATE;</PRE>

<H4>Flags</H4>

<DL>
<DT>PNP_DEVICE_DISABLED</DT>

<DD>The device is physically present but is disabled in hardware.</DD>

<DT>PNP_DEVICE_DONT_DISPLAY_IN_UI</DT>

<DD>Don't display the device in the user interface. Set for a device that is physically present but not usable in the current configuration, such as a game port on a laptop that is not usable when the laptop is undocked. (Also see the <B>NodisplayInUI</B> flag in the <A HREF="k112_22r6.htm">DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</A> structure.)</DD>

<DT>PNP_DEVICE_FAILED</DT>

<DD>The device is present but not functioning properly. 

<P>When both this flag and PNP_DEVICE_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_CHANGED are set, the device must be stopped before the PnP Manager assigns new hardware resources (nonstop rebalance is not supported for the device).
</DD>

<DT>PNP_DEVICE_NOT_DISABLEABLE</DT>

<DD>The device must not be disabled. 

<P>A driver sets this bit for a device that is required for proper system operation. For example, if a driver receives notification that a device is in the paging path (IRP_MN_DEVICE_USAGE_NOTIFICATION for <B>DeviceUsageTypePaging</B>), the driver calls <B>IoInvalidateDeviceState</B> and sets this flag in the resulting IRP_MN_QUERY_PNP_DEVICE_STATE IRP.


<P>If this bit is set for a device, the PnP Manager propagates this setting to the device's parent device, its parent's parent device, and so forth. 


<P>If this bit is set for a nonenumerable device, the device cannot be disabled or uninstalled.
</DD>

<DT>PNP_DEVICE_REMOVED</DT>

<DD>The device has been physically removed. </DD>

<DT>PNP_DEVICE_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_CHANGED</DT>

<DD>The resource requirements for the device have changed.

<P>Typically, a bus driver sets this flag when it has determined that it must expand its resource requirements in order to enumerate a new child device.

</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Headers</H4>

<P>Defined in <I>wdm.h</I> and <I>ntddk.h</I>. Include <I>wdm.h</I> or <I>ntddk.h</I>.</P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>The PnP Manager queries a device's PNP_DEVICE_STATE right after starting the device by sending an IRP_MN_QUERY_PNP_DEVICE_STATE request to the device stack. In response to this IRP, the drivers for the device set the appropriate flags in PNP_DEVICE_STATE.</P>

<P>If any of the state characteristics change after the initial query, a driver notifies the PnP Manager by calling <B>IoInvalidateDeviceState</B>. In response to a call to <B>IoInvalidateDeviceState</B>, the PnP Manager queries the device's PNP_DEVICE_STATE again.</P>

<P>If a device is marked PNP_DEVICE_NOT_DISABLEABLE, the debugger displays a DNUF_NOT_DISABLEABLE user flag for the devnode. The debugger also displays a <B>DisableableDepends</B> value that counts the number of reasons why the device cannot be disabled. This value is the sum of X+Y, where X is one if the device cannot be disabled and Y is the count of the device's child devices that cannot be disabled.</P>
