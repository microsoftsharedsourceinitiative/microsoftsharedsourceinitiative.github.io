<P>Because Windows is a portable operating system, devices and their drivers must be both hardware-configurable and software-configurable.</P>

<P>For example, in a hot-plug RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) configuration, a user can swap disks while they are running. Such a device is <I>hardware-configurable</I>. Its driver cannot assume that a given disk device will be fixed at a particular location. Therefore, to remain portable, its driver must not contain hard-coded machine-dependent values.  </P>

<P>The driver of this type of disk device might provide hardware-level support to one or more file systems in any given machine, depending on how the user partitions the disks. In addition, an intermediate driver might support fault tolerance (mirrored partitions, stripe sets, and/or volume sets) for higher level file system drivers in machines with sufficient mass storage capacity. In other words, the same physical disk driver could provide support to more than one type of higher level driver in some machines but not in others. Such a disk driver is <I>software-configurable</I>, as are all intermediate and file system drivers that ultimately depend on support from underlying device and/or Plug and Play (PnP) hardware bus drivers.</P>

<P>The HAL component, implemented as a dynamic-link library, is responsible for all hardware-level, platform-specific support needed by every other component in the system, including kernel-mode drivers. The HAL exports support routines that hide platform-specific hardware details about caches, I/O buses, interrupts, and so forth, to provide an interface between the platform's hardware and the system's software components, including all drivers. </P>

<P>The system-supplied PnP hardware bus drivers, in cooperation with the PnP Manager, provide similar functionality to the HAL component. That is, the PnP Manager and each PnP hardware bus driver collaborate to provide an interface between the platform's hardware for a specific type of I/O bus and the system's software. </P>

<P>The PnP Manager builds a <A HREF="plugplay_29ev.htm">device tree</A>, with nodes representing all the devices on the system, including buses and the devices connected to them. For each device, the PnP Manager maintains two lists: a list of the <A HREF="plugplay_1xk7.htm">hardware resources</A> the device is capable of using and a list of the hardware resources actually assigned to the device. Device drivers assist the PnP Manager in creating these lists, which are maintained in the registry. As devices are added to and removed from the system, the PnP Manager reassigns resources as necessary and updates the lists. </P>
