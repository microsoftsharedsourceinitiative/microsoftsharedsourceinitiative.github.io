<P>A caller must also handle the following issues when calling a callee:

<UL>
	<LI>Function Pointers
<P>Function pointers are simply pointers to the label of the respective function. There are no parameter-passing requirements for function pointers.
</LI>

	<LI>Legacy Floating-Point Support
<P>The MMX and floating-point stack registers (MM0-MM7/ST0-ST7) are volatile. That is, these legacy floating-point stack registers do not have their state preserved across context switches.
</LI>

	<LI>MxCsr
<P>The register state should also include MxCsr. The callee can modify the register, and the caller determines that the callee left a valid value in the register. This register is saved on entry to the system (a user-mode to kernel-mode transition) and reinitialized with the value expected for system code. The system code uses floating point and has its own control/status value. On exit from the system (a kernel-mode to user-mode translation), the user’s MxCsr is reloaded.
</LI>
</UL>
