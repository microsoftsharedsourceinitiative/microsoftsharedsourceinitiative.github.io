<P>Drivers of mass-storage devices that have internal caches for data must handle this request in a <A HREF="drvrrtns_9fea.htm"><I>DispatchShutdown</I></A> routine. Drivers of mass-storage devices and intermediate drivers layered over them also must handle this request if an underlying driver maintains internal buffers for data.</P>

<H4>When Sent</H4>

<P>Receipt of a shutdown request indicates that a file system driver is sending notice that the system is being shut down.</P>

<P>One or more file system drivers can send such a lower-level driver more than one shutdown request when a user logs off or when the system is being shut down for some other reason.</P>

<H4>Input Parameters</H4>

<P>None</P>

<H4>Output Parameters</H4>

<P>None</P>

<H4>Operation</H4>

<P>The driver must complete the transfer of any data currently cached in the device or held in the driver’s internal buffers before completing the shutdown request.</P>

<P>A driver does not receive an IRP_MJ_SHUTDOWN request for a device object unless it registers to do so with either <A HREF="k104_1jjm.htm"><B>IoRegisterShutdownNotification</B></A> or <A HREF="k104_36b6.htm"><B>IoRegisterLastChanceShutdownNotification</B></A>.</P>
