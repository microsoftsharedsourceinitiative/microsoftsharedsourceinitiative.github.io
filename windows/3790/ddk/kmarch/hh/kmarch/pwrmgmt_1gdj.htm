<P>Drivers that support power management must also support <A HREF="plugplay_15t3.htm">Plug and Play</A> (PnP), because some power management operations are closely tied to adding and removing devices, and drivers receive notification of these events by means of PnP IRPs. Additionally, drivers report a device's support for power management in response to PnP queries for device capabilities.</P>

<P>Power management works on two levels: one applies to individual devices and the other to the system as a whole. </P>

<P>The Power Manager, part of the operating system kernel, manages the power level of the entire system. If all drivers in the system support power management, the Power Manager can manage power consumption on a system-wide basis, utilizing not only the fully on and fully off states, but also various intermediate system sleep states. </P>

<P>Legacy drivers that were written before the operating system supported power management continue to work as they did previously. However, systems that include legacy drivers cannot enter any of the intermediate system sleep states; they can operate only in the fully on or fully off states as before. </P>

<P>Device power management applies to individual devices. A driver that supports power management can turn its device on when it is needed and off when it is not in use. Devices that have the hardware capability can enter intermediate device power states. The presence of legacy drivers in the system does not affect the ability of newer drivers to manage power for their devices. </P>
