<P>The Power Manager sends a power IRP with the minor IRP code <A HREF="poirp_9e9e.htm">IRP_MN_QUERY_POWER</A> and <B>SystemPowerState</B> in <B>Parameters.Power.Type</B> to determine whether it can safely change to a specified system power state (S1-S5) and to allow drivers to prepare for such a change. </P>

<P>Whenever possible, the Power Manager queries before sending an <A HREF="poirp_6hde.htm">IRP_MN_SET_POWER</A> that requests a lower (less powered) state. However, in cases of a failing battery or imminent loss of power, the Power Manager sends the set-power IRP without querying first. The Power Manager never sends a query before sending an IRP to set the system in the working state (S0). </P>

<P>For information about how a power policy owner for a device handles system query-power requests, see <A HREF="pwrmgmt_8tyf.htm">Handling a System Query-Power IRP in a Device Power Policy Owner</A>.</P>

<P>For information about how drivers (that are not the power policy owner for a device) handle system query-power requests, see the following:</P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="pwrmgmt_0so7.htm">Handling a System Query-Power IRP in a Filter or Function Driver</A></P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="pwrmgmt_89lz.htm">Failing a System Query-Power IRP in a Filter or Function Driver</A></P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="pwrmgmt_4m1z.htm">Handling a System Query-Power IRP in a Bus Driver</A></P>

<P>Note that a driver must <I>never</I> send a device IRP_MN_SET_POWER request in response to a system query; it requests such an IRP only after it receives a system set-power request. </P>

<P>Because the Power Manager sends the system query IRP to each device stack on the system, it is possible that a driver for one device might fail the query while drivers for other devices complete it successfully. It is also possible that a battery might expire while a query is active, requiring an immediate shutdown. Consequently, after a query IRP, drivers must be prepared to receive any of the following power IRPs:

<UL>
	<LI>An IRP_MN_SET_POWER to the queried state</LI>

	<LI>An IRP_MN_SET_POWER to a different power state</LI>

	<LI>An IRP_MN_SET_POWER to the current power state</LI>

	<LI>An IRP_MN_QUERY_POWER to any state</LI>
</UL>

<P>Usually, however, a driver receives a system set-power IRP following a system query IRP. If the query succeeded, the set-power IRP specifies the queried state. If the query failed, the set-power IRP reaffirms the current power state. </P>
