<P>A named device object has a name of the form <B>\Device\</B><I>DeviceName</I>.  This is known as the <I>NT device name</I> of the device object.</P>

<H4>Device Names for WDM Drivers</H4>

<P>WDM drivers do not name their device objects directly.  Instead, the system imposes a uniform naming scheme that ensures that device names do not conflict between drivers.  The naming scheme for WDM drivers is as follows.

<UL>
	<LI>The PDO for a device is named.  The bus driver requests named PDOs for the devices it enumerates.  The bus driver specifies the FILE_AUTOGENERATED_DEVICE_NAME device characteristic when it creates the device object.  For more information, see <A HREF="devobjts_7usn.htm">Specifying Device Characteristics</A>.  The system then automatically generates the device name.</LI>

	<LI>FDOs and filter DOs are not named.  Function and filter drivers do not request a name when creating the device object.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Any I/O request to a named device object automatically goes to the top object in that device object's stack.  Thus, only the PDO is required to be named.  User-mode applications do not refer to WDM device objects by name; instead, applications access the device object through its <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">device interface</A>.  For more information, see <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_2.Click()">Device Interface Classes</A>.</P>

<P>Driver writers must not name more than one object in a device stack.  The operating system checks security settings based on the named object.  If two different objects are named and have different security descriptors, the I/O requests that are sent to the object with the weaker security descriptor can reach the device object with the stronger security descriptor.</P>

<H4>Device Names for non-WDM Drivers</H4>

<P>A non-WDM driver must explicitly specify a name for any named device objects.  The driver must create at least one named device object in the <B>\Device</B> object directory to receive I/O requests.  The driver specifies the device name as the <I>DeviceName</I> parameter to <B>IoCreateDeviceSecure</B> when creating the device object.</P>
