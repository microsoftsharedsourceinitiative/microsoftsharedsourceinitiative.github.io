<P>The integrated power management features supported by Microsoft® Windows® operating systems are available only on computers that have an Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) BIOS. </P>

<P>An ACPI BIOS provides features at the hardware level that make software power management possible. At boot time, the operating system loader checks whether such a BIOS is loaded. If so, ACPI is enabled in the operating system. If such a BIOS is not loaded, ACPI is disabled and the less robust Advanced Power Management (APM) model is used instead. </P>

<P>By default, Windows&nbsp;2000 and later systems assume that any ACPI BIOS dated January 1, 1999 or later is Windows&nbsp;2000 ready. However, if such a BIOS is known to exhibit ACPI problems, the loader disables ACPI and instead uses APM.</P>

<P>The Device Manager shows whether an individual computer supports ACPI. </P>
