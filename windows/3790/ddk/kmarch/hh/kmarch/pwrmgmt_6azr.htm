<P>A <I>device power IRP</I> specifies major IRP code <A HREF="k113_7jjm.htm">IRP_MJ_POWER</A>, one of the minor power IRP codes listed below, and the value <B>DevicePowerState</B> in the <B>Power.Type </B>member. </P>

<P>All drivers in a device stack receive such IRPs; normally, only the device power policy manager can send these IRPs. However, the Power Manager can send a device power IRP when performing idle detection on behalf of a device, as explained in <A HREF="pwrmgmt_8q07.htm">Using Power Manager Routines for Idle Detection</A>.</P>

<P>A driver sends a device power IRP for any of the following reasons:

<UL>
	<LI>To query or change the device power state in response to a system power IRP</LI>

	<LI>To put the device in a sleep state to conserve power</LI>

	<LI>To return the device to the working state after it has been asleep</LI>

	<LI>To enable the device to awaken in response to an external signal</LI>

	<LI>To get a power sequence value when powering up a device</LI>
</UL>

<P><IMG SRC="images/devpoirp.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><B>Path of a Device Power IRP</B></P>

<P>As the previous figure shows, a device power IRP is sent, forwarded, and completed in the following steps:

<OL>
	<LI>The device power policy owner calls <A HREF="portn_55gy.htm"><B>PoRequestPowerIrp</B></A> to allocate a device power IRP, specifying the PDO that is the target of the IRP and a callback routine to be invoked when the IRP is complete.</LI>

	<LI>The Power Manager allocates a device power IRP and sends it to the top driver in the device stack for the target PDO. </LI>

	<LI>The driver performs the following actions:
<UL>
	<LI>Sets an <A HREF="drvrrtns_4rsi.htm"><I>IoCompletion</I></A> routine if one is necessary.</LI>

	<LI>Calls <A HREF="portn_83ua.htm"><B>PoStartNextPowerIrp</B></A> if a completion routine is not used.</LI>

	<LI>Calls <A HREF="portn_7tki.htm"><B>PoCallDriver</B></A> to pass the IRP down to the next-lower driver. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Each driver in the stack does this until the IRP reaches the bus driver. If a driver must fail the IRP, it should do so immediately and call <A HREF="k104_1fhu.htm"><B>IoCompleteRequest</B></A>.
</LI>

	<LI>The bus driver, which maintains the device PDO, performs the requested action, and then calls <B>IoCompleteRequest</B> to complete the IRP. A bus driver can fail a device power-up IRP if a device is removed or in the process of being removed.</LI>

	<LI>The I/O Manager calls <I>IoCompletion</I> routines that were set by drivers as they passed the IRP down the stack. After all the <I>IoCompletion</I> routines have been called, the callback routine is run.</LI>
</OL>
