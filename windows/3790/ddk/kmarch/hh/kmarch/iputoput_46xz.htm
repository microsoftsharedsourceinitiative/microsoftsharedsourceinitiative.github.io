<P>Drivers for devices that can transfer large amounts of data at a time should use <A HREF="iputoput_3m07.htm#ddk_direct_i_o_kg">direct I/O</A> for those transfers. Using direct I/O for large transfers improves a driver's performance, both by reducing its interrupt overhead and by eliminating the memory allocation and copying operations inherent in buffered I/O. </P>

<P>Generally, mass-storage device drivers request direct I/O for transfer requests, including lowest-level drivers that use direct memory access (DMA) or programmed I/O (PIO), as well as any intermediate drivers chained above them.</P>

<P>The I/O Manager determines that an I/O operation is using direct I/O as follows:

<UL>
	<LI>For <A HREF="k113_7fhu.htm">IRP_MJ_READ</A> and <A HREF="k113_45o2.htm">IRP_MJ_WRITE</A> requests, DO_DIRECT_IO is set in the <B>Flags</B> member of the <A HREF="k112_32cy.htm">DEVICE_OBJECT</A> structure. For more information, see <A HREF="devobjts_8zdz.htm">Initializing a Device Object</A>.</LI>

	<LI>For <A HREF="k113_0hiq.htm">IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL</A> and <A HREF="k113_2yia.htm">IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL</A> requests, the IOCTL code's value contains METHOD_IN_DIRECT or METHOD_OUT_DIRECT as the <I>TransferType</I> value in the IOCTL value. For more information, see <A HREF="irps_1l0n.htm">Defining I/O Control Codes</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Drivers that use direct I/O will sometimes also use buffered I/O to handle some IRPs. In particular, drivers typically use buffered I/O for some I/O control codes for IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL requests that require data transfers, whether or not the driver uses direct I/O for read and write operations.</P>

<P>Setting up a direct I/O transfers varies slightly, depending on whether DMA or PIO is being used. For more information, see:</P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="iputoput_8x47.htm">Using Direct I/O with PIO</A> </P>

<P>Drivers must take steps to maintain cache coherency during DMA and PIO transfers. For more information, see <A HREF="iputoput_7pgn.htm">Maintaining Cache Coherency</A>.</P>
