<P>Some devices, such as keyboards, modems, and network cards, can respond to external signals while in a device sleep state. As part of its power management technology, the operating system provides a way for such devices to wake a sleeping system, which can then restore its previous context. The software wake-up mechanism allows a system to awaken from any state except S5 (<B>PowerSystemShutdown</B>), depending on support in the system and device hardware and BIOS. A system in state S5 must always be rebooted. </P>

<P>Although the operating system is designed to awaken from any of the intermediate sleep states, the exact wake-up capabilities vary from computer to computer and device to device. Not all computers support all system sleep states; therefore, the ability to wake from certain states is meaningless on some computers. </P>

<P>Similarly, most devices neither support all device states (D0 through D3) nor support wake-up from all the device states that they do support.</P>

<P>The sleep states that a device can enter, along with the states from which it supports wake up, are described at enumeration by the bus driver and are stored in the <A HREF="k112_22r6.htm">DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</A> structure. The following table lists the members of this structure that are relevant to wait/wake support.</P>

</TABLE><BR>

<P>The <B>DeviceWake</B> entry lists the lowest-powered device state from which the device can respond to a wake-up signal. The value <B>PowerDeviceUnspecified</B> indicates that the device cannot wake the system. The <B>SystemWake</B> entry lists the lowest-powered state from which the system can be awakened. These values are based on the capabilities of the parent devnode and drivers should not change them. For more information, see <A HREF="pwrmgmt_0iw7.htm">Reporting Device Power Capabilities</A>.</P>

<P>In general, a device can wake the system if the following are true:

<UL>
	<LI>The device is in a power state equal to or more-powered than the <B>DeviceWake</B> value.</LI>

	<LI>The system is in a power state equal to or more powered than the <B>SystemWake</B> value. </LI>
