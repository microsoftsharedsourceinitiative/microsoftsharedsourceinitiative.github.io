<P>A device power state describes the power state of a particular device. Device power states are named D<I>x</I>, where <I>x</I> is a state number between 0 and 3. The state number is inversely related to power consumption: higher numbered states use less power.</P>

<P>Device power states are defined in terms of the following criteria:

<UL>
	<LI>Power consumption: How much power does the device use?</LI>

	<LI>Device context: How much of its operational context does the device retain in this state?</LI>

	<LI>Device driver behavior: What must the drivers for the device do to restore the device to the fully operational state?</LI>

	<LI>Restore time: How long does it take to restore the device to the fully operational state? </LI>

	<LI>Wake-up capability: Can the device request wake-up from this state? In general, if a device can request wake-up from a given power state (D2, for example), it can also request wake-up from any higher-powered state (D1).</LI>
</UL>

<P>The exact definitions of the power states are device-specific. Not all devices define all the states; many devices define only the D0 and D3 states. See the <I>Device Class Power Management Reference Specification</I> to find out which device states are defined for a specific device and what the operational requirements are for each state. (The specification is available at the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=8703&clcid=0x409" target="_blank">Windows Platform Development</A> Web site.)</P>

<P>The power state of a device need not match the power state of the system. For example, some devices can be in the off (D3) state even though the system is in the working (S0) <A HREF="pwrmgmt_919j.htm">system power state</A>. Usually, a device's power state is no higher than that of the system because many devices get their power from the system. Devices that are enabled to wake the system are exceptions, however; such devices are typically in a low-latency sleeping state (D1 or D2) when the system is in a sleeping state.</P>

<P>Note that some devices are capable of several different low power modes within a single device power state. Such a device can use these modes if its driver can automatically switch the device from one mode to another without changing the device power state. As a general rule, however, if there is no user-perceptible difference between the modes, the device should use only the lowest power mode. If a low power mode, such as a low speed, adversely affects performance or is not transparent to software other than the device driver, the hardware should not automatically use it. See the <I>Device Class Power Management Reference Specifications</I> for details.</P>

<P>A driver or the Power Manager can request a device power state transition, and all drivers must be prepared to handle IRPs that request such transitions. For details, see:</P>

<P>Like the system, a device can transition from the working state (D0) to any sleeping state (D1-D3) and from any sleeping state to the working state. </P>
