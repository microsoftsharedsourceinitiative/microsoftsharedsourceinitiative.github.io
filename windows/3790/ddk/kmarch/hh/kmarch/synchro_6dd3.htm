<P>Some drivers create their own driver- or device-dedicated system threads and set their thread's base priority to the lowest real-time priority value. Other highest-level drivers, particularly file system drivers, use system worker threads with a base priority that is usually set to the highest variable priority value. The kernel schedules a thread with the lowest real-time priority to run ahead of every thread with a variable priority, which includes almost every user-mode thread in the system.</P>

<P>Most standard driver routines are run in an arbitrary thread context, ahead of all threads that are currently in the ready state.</P>

<P>Threads, whatever their respective run-time priorities, are run at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL. Many standard driver routines are run at <I>raised IRQL</I>: that is, at a hardware priority greater than PASSIVE_LEVEL, such as IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL or DIRQL.</P>
