<P>The <B>IoRegisterDriverReinitialization</B> routine is called by a driver during its initialization or reinitialization to register its <A HREF="drvrrtns_2i0i.htm"><I>Reinitialize</I></A> routine to be called again before the driver’s and, possibly the system’s, initialization is complete.</P>

<P>A driver can call this routine only if its <A HREF="drvrrtns_6r76.htm"><B>DriverEntry</B></A> routine will return STATUS_SUCCESS. If the driver-supplied <A HREF="drvrrtns_2i0i.htm"><I>Reinitialize</I></A> routine must use the registry, the <B>DriverEntry</B> routine should include a copy of the string to which  <I>RegistryPath</I> points as part of the context passed to the <I>Reinitialize</I> routine in this call.</P>

<P>If the driver is loaded dynamically, it is possible for this to occur during a normally running system, so all references to the reinitialization queue must be synchronized.</P>

<P>The <I>Count</I> input to a <I>DriverReinitializationRoutine</I> indicates how many times this routine has been called, including the current call.</P>

<P>The <B>DriverEntry</B> routine can call <B>IoRegisterDriverReinitialization</B> only once. If the <I>Reinitialize</I> routine should be run again after any other drivers' <I>Reinitialize</I> routines have returned control, the <I>Reinitialize</I> routine also can call <B>IoRegisterDriverReinitialization</B> as many times as the driver's <I>Reinitialize</I> routine should be run. </P>

<P>Usually, a driver with a <I>Reinitialize</I> routine is a higher-level driver that controls both PnP and legacy devices. Such a driver must not only create device objects for the devices that the PnP Manager detects (and for which the PnP Manager calls the driver's <A HREF="drvrrtns_4d6a.htm"><I>AddDevice</I></A> routine), the driver must also create device objects for legacy devices that the PnP Manager does not detect. A driver can use a <I>Reinitialize</I> routine to create those device objects and layer the driver over the next-lower driver for the underlying device.</P>

<P>Callers of <B>IoRegisterDriverReinitialization</B> must be running at IRQL&nbsp;= PASSIVE_LEVEL.</P>
