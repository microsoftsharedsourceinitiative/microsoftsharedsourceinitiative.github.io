<P>A filter or function driver (that is not the power policy owner for a device) can fail an <A HREF="poirp_9e9e.htm">IRP_MN_QUERY_POWER</A> request if either of the following is true:

<UL>
	<LI>The device is enabled for wake-up and the requested system power state is less powered than the value of <A HREF="pwrmgmt_4exz.htm"><B>SystemWake</B></A>, which specifies the least-powered state from which the device can wake the system. For example, a device that can wake the system from S2 but not from S3 would fail a query for S3 but succeed a query for S2.</LI>

	<LI>Entering a device state that corresponds to the requested state would force the driver to abandon an operation that would lose data, such as an open modem connection. A driver rarely will fail a query for this reason; under most circumstances, the application handles such cases. </LI>
</UL>

<P>To fail an IRP_MN_QUERY_POWER request for a system power state, a driver should take the following steps:

<OL>
	<LI>Call <A HREF="portn_83ua.htm"><B>PoStartNextPowerIrp</B></A> to indicate its readiness to handle the next power IRP.</LI>

	<LI>Set <B>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status</B> to a failure status and call <A HREF="k104_1fhu.htm"><B>IoCompleteRequest</B></A>, specifying IO_NO_INCREMENT. Do not pass the IRP further down the device stack. </LI>

	<LI>Call <A HREF="k104_8n5e.htm"><B>IoReleaseRemoveLock</B></A> to release the previously acquired lock.</LI>

	<LI>Return a failure status from its<I> <A HREF="drvrrtns_00mq.htm">DispatchPower</A></I> routine.</LI>
</OL>
