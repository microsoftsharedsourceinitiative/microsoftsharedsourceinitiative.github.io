<P>The power policy owner checks the <A HREF="pwrmgmt_1o2v.htm"><B>DeviceState</B></A><B> </B>array in the DEVICE_CAPABILITIES structure to determine the valid range of device power states for each system state. The array lists the highest-powered state the underlying device can support for each system state. </P>

<P>When choosing a specific state from this range, consider the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Most devices enter the D0 state when the system enters the S0 state. </LI>

	<LI>Most devices enter the D3 state when the system enters any sleeping state. However, a device that is enabled for wake-up might be required to enter D1 or D2 instead, if it supports such states. For further information, see <A HREF="pwrmgmt_0iw7.htm">Reporting Device Power Capabilities</A>. </LI>

	<LI>Special rules apply for the device that will hold the hibernation file. If the system IRP requests <B>PowerSystemHibernate</B>, the device that will hold the hibernation file must not power off. The power policy owner for such a device should request device state D3 and save context, but the device's drivers must not power off the device. </LI>
</UL>

<P>If the system IRP requests <B>PowerSystemShutdown</B>, the driver should check the POWER_ACTION value at <B>Irp-&gt;Parameters.Power.ShutdownType</B> to determine the reason for the state change. For further information, see <A HREF="pwrmgmt_26qv.htm">System Power Actions</A>. </P>

<P>The device power policy owner must send a device set-power IRP for each system set-power IRP, even if the device is already in the correct device state. If the driver previously suspended device operations in response to a query-power IRP, the set-power IRP notifies it to stop queuing IRPs and return to normal operation for its current power state. The only exception occurs when the device is in the D3 state; in this case, the driver need not send an additional IRP_MN_SET_POWER request for D3. </P>
