<P>Legacy drivers and high-level file system drivers, which do not handle PnP device-removal requests, must release resources, delete device objects, and detach from the device stack in their <I>Unload</I> routines. </P>

<P>If it has not done so already, the first thing a legacy device driver should do in its <I>Unload</I> routine is to disable interrupts from the device. Otherwise, its ISR might be called to handle a device interrupt while the <I>Unload</I> routine is releasing resources in the device extension that the ISR needs to handle the interrupt. Even if its ISR runs successfully in these circumstances, the <I>DpcForIsr</I> or <I>CustomDpc</I> routine that the ISR queues, and possibly other driver routines that run at IRQL &gt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL, will execute before the <I>Unload</I> routine regains control, thereby increasing the likelihood that the <I>Unload</I> routine has deleted a resource that another driver routine references. See <A HREF="intrupts_0kh3.htm">Managing Hardware Priorities</A> for more information.</P>

<P>After disabling interrupts, file system and legacy drivers must release resources and objects. For details, see the following two sections:</P>
