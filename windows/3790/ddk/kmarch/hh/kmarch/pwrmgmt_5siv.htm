<P>After the bus driver completes the IRP, the I/O Manager calls the<I> IoCompletion</I> routines registered by higher-level drivers as they passed the IRP down the stack. </P>

<P>Whenever a device enters the D0 state, each of its drivers should set an<I> IoCompletion</I> routine that performs most of the tasks required to return it to the working state. Drivers should set an IoCompletion routine for any transition to the D0 state, whether the device is returning from a sleeping state or entering D0 at system start-up. The following figure shows the tasks such an IoCompletion routine should perform:</P>

<P><B>Device Power-Up<I> IoCompletion</I> Routine</B></P>

<P>These tasks include:

<UL>
	<LI>Restoring device state or reinitializing the device, as required, and preparing to handle any I/O queued by drivers while the device was not in the working state</LI>

	<LI>Calling <A HREF="portn_5saa.htm"><B>PoSetPowerState</B></A> to notify the Power Manager that the device is in the D0 power state.</LI>

	<LI>Calling <A HREF="portn_83ua.htm"><B>PoStartNextPowerIrp</B></A> to receive the next power IRP, if the driver did not originally send the current power IRP.</LI>

	<LI>Freeing memory allocated for the device context.</LI>

	<LI>Calling <A HREF="k104_8n5e.htm"><B>IoReleaseRemoveLock</B></A> to free the lock that the driver acquired in its<I> DispatchPower</I> routine when it received the IRP.</LI>

	<LI>Returning STATUS_SUCCESS.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The bus driver does not power up the device until it or higher drivers must communicate with the device.</P>

<P>When its device enters a sleeping state, a driver should set an<I> IoCompletion</I> routine that simply calls <A HREF="portn_83ua.htm"><B>PoStartNextPowerIrp</B></A> and releases the remove lock. Remember that a driver cannot access its device while the device is in a sleeping state.</P>
