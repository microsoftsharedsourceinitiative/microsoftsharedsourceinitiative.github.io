<P>The 64-bit version of Microsoft® Windows® is designed to make it possible for developers to use a single source-code base for their Win32®- and Win64™-based applications. To a large extent, this is also true for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows drivers.</P>

<P>For user-mode applications, 64-bit Windows includes a Windows on Windows (WOW64) <I>thunking</I> layer that enables Win32 applications to execute (with some performance degradation) on Win64 systems. It does this by intercepting Win32 function calls and converting pointer-precision parameter types to fixed-precision types as appropriate before making the transition to the 64-bit kernel. This conversion process is called <I>thunking</I>.</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This thunking is only done for 32-bit <I>applications</I>; 32-bit <I>drivers</I> are not supported on 64-bit Windows.</P>
