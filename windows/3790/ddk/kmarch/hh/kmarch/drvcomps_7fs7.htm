<P>A driver's <A HREF="drvrrtns_0zoy.htm"><I>DispatchDeviceControl</I></A> and <A HREF="drvrrtns_0cvm.htm"><I>DispatchInternalDeviceControl</I></A> routines handle IRPs with I/O function codes of <A HREF="k113_0hiq.htm">IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL</A> and <A HREF="k113_2yia.htm">IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL</A>, respectively.</P>

<P>For every common type of peripheral device, the system defines a set of I/O control codes for IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL requests. New drivers for each type of device must support these requests. In most cases, these public I/O control codes for each type of device are not exported to user-mode applications. </P>

<P>Some of these system-defined I/O control codes are used by higher-level drivers that create IRPs for the underlying device driver by calling <A HREF="k104_8ble.htm"><B>IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest</B></A>. Others are used by Win32® components to communicate with an underlying device driver by calling the Win32 function <B>DeviceIoControl</B> (described in Platform SDK documentation) which, in turn, calls a system service. The I/O Manager sets up an IRP, and stores the major function code IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL and the given I/O control code in the <A HREF="k112_49bm.htm">IO_STACK_LOCATION</A> structure at <B>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.IoControlCode</B>. Then, the I/O Manager calls the <I>DispatchDeviceControl</I> routine of the highest-level driver in the chain.</P>

<P>For certain system-supplied drivers designed to interoperate with and support new drivers, the operating system also defines a set of I/O control codes for IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL requests. In most cases, these public I/O control codes allow add-on higher-level drivers to interoperate with an underlying device driver.</P>

<P>As an example, the system-supplied parallel drivers support a set of internal I/O control codes that vendor-supplied drivers send in IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL requests. For more information, see <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()">Internal Device Control Requests for Parallel Ports</A> and <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_2.Click()">Internal Device Control Requests for Parallel Devices</A>.</P>

<P>Almost all operations requested through system-defined I/O control codes use buffered I/O, because this type of request seldom requires the transfer of large amounts of data. That is, even drivers that set up their device objects for direct I/O are sent IRPs for device control requests with data to be transferred into or out of the buffer at <B>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</B> (except for certain types of highest-level device drivers with closely coupled Win32 multimedia drivers).</P>

<P>In addition, a driver can define a set of private I/O control codes that other drivers can use to communicate with it. New public I/O control codes can be added to the system only with the cooperation of Microsoft Corporation, because public I/O control codes are built into the operating system itself. </P>

<P>For specific information about the set of public I/O control codes that different kinds of drivers must support and about defining private I/O control codes, see the device-specific reference sections of this DDK. </P>
