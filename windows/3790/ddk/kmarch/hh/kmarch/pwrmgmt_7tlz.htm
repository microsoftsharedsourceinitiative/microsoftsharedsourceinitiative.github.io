<P>Consult the relevant <I>Device Class Power Management Reference Specification</I> to find out which device states are defined for the class of device with which you are working with and what the operational requirements are for each state. These specifications are available at the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=8703&clcid=0x409" target="_blank">Windows Platform Development</A> Web site.</P>

<P>Legacy devices and other devices for which no power management specification exists should follow the <I>Default Device Class Power Management Specification</I>. In essence, the default specification requires the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Support for the D0 and D3 states</LI>

	<LI>A driver that saves and restores or reinitializes device context when the device is powered on </LI>

	<LI>A driver that manages the device power policy</LI>
</UL>

<P>Class and port drivers supplied with the system and by IHVs typically support power management. If you are writing a minidriver that links to such a driver, check the relevant class or port driver documentation in this DDK to find out the extent of power management support required in the minidriver. The following general guidelines apply:

<UL>
	<LI>Network adapter drivers must conform to the NDIS 5.0 specification and power management interfaces, described in the device class reference specifications and elsewhere in this DDK.</LI>

	<LI>Streaming drivers use the power management interfaces in the streaming class driver to handle device states D0 and D3. To handle device states D1 and D2, these drivers must use the power management interfaces described in this section. </LI>

	<LI>The SCSI port driver manages most of the PnP and power management requirements for the miniport. SCSI miniport drivers must support PnP and power management interfaces along with related routines such as <A HREF="JavaScript:hhobj_1.Click()"><B>HwScsiAdapterControl</B></A>.</LI>

	<LI>The video port driver manages most of the PnP and power management requirements for the miniport. Video miniport drivers must support miniport-specific routines, which are described elsewhere in this DDK.</LI>
</UL>
