<P>There are two ways for drivers to determine whether the originator of an IOCTL or FSCTL request is a 32-bit or 64-bit application. The first is for the application to identify itself. The second is for the driver to determine on its own whether the application is 32-bit or 64-bit.</P>

<P>The first technique involves defining a "64Bit" field in the IOCTL or FSCTL control code. This field contains a single bit, which is set only for 64-bit callers. Thus 64-bit callers identify themselves by using a separate set of 64-bit control codes in which this bit is set. 32-bit callers use a similar set of control codes in which this bit is not set.</P>

<P>The second technique permits 32- and 64-bit applications to continue using the same IOCTL or FSCTL codes. Instead, the driver determines whether the user-mode process is 32- or 64-bit by calling <A HREF="k104_8zea.htm"><B>IoIs32bitProcess</B></A>.</P>

<P>The first technique is more efficient, because the driver checks a bit flag instead of calling a kernel-mode routine. However, the second technique requires no changes to user-mode code. Which technique you should use depends on the requirements of your driver and the applications that send I/O requests to it. </P>
