<P>Power management requires support from system and device hardware and from system software and drivers. Required hardware support is covered in the industry specifications, as described in the previous section. This topic covers the software support — specifically, what drivers must do to conform to operating system requirements and to manage power as appropriate for their devices.</P>

<P>The following figure shows a system-wide overview of power management.</P>

<P><B>System-Wide Overview of Power Management</B></P>

<P>Through APIs and Control Panel, applications and users have input to power management decisions. Users can set certain power options through Control Panel, including device-specific GUID controls that the user interface presents if the corresponding drivers support them. Through WMI, Control Panel notifies the Power Manager and drivers of changes in the GUID controls.</P>

<P>The Power Manager administers the system-wide <I>power policy</I>, the rules that govern the system's power usage. (For more information, see <A HREF="pwrmgmt_8baf.htm">System Power Policy</A>.) Using information from Control Panel and APIs, the Power Manager can determine when applications are using, or might need to use, various devices, so that it can adjust the system's power policy appropriately.</P>

<P>The Power Manager also provides an interface for drivers that is comprised of  <A HREF="portn_3vqq.htm">power management support routines</A>, <A HREF="poirp_6jua.htm">power management minor IRPs</A>, and required driver entry points.</P>

<P>When the Power Manager requests a change to the system power state, drivers respond by putting their devices in an appropriate device power state. In addition, drivers can perform idle detection for their devices and put unused devices in a sleep state. Bus-specific mechanisms report device power capabilities, set and report device status, and change device power. Exactly how and when device power is changed depends on the type of device and the capabilities of the device hardware. </P>

<P>Although ACPI hardware realizes the greatest power savings, the hardware need not be ACPI-compliant for power management in drivers to be effective. </P>
