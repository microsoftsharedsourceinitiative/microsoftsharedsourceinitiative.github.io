<P>On some platforms, the instruction and data caches in the processor exhibit cache coherency anomalies during PIO read operations. </P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain data integrity during their read operations, drivers that use PIO must follow this guideline: </P>

<P class=note>Call <A HREF="k105_6asy.htm"><B>KeFlushIoBuffers</B></A> at the end of each read operation. </P>

<P class=note>For example, a driver making a PIO transfer from its device to system memory should call <B>KeFlushIoBuffers</B> at the end of each device transfer operation. As another example, a driver that reads a sequence of device registers into system memory should call <B>KeFlushIoBuffers</B> at the end of the sequence. Otherwise, such a driver might attempt to access data that is still in the processor’s data cache, rather than in system memory, on some platforms. </P>

<P><B>KeFlushIoBuffers</B> does nothing if the processor can be relied on to maintain cache coherency, so calls to this support routine have almost no overhead in such a platform. </P>
