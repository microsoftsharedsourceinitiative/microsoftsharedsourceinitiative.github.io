<P>Most drivers must handle the following <I>Dispatch</I> routines:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="drvrrtns_8uya.htm"><I>DispatchPnP</I></A><I> </I>
<P>IRP_MJ_PNP indicates a request involving PnP device recognition, hardware configuration, or resource allocation. Such requests are typically sent to a device driver from the PnP Manager or from a closely coupled higher-level driver.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="drvrrtns_00mq.htm"><I>DispatchPower</I></A><I> </I>
<P>IRP_MJ_POWER indicates a request pertaining to the power state of either the device or the system. Such requests are sent to the device driver by either the Power Manager or a closely coupled higher-level driver.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="drvrrtns_8g4y.htm"><I>DispatchCreate</I></A><I> </I>
<P>IRP_MJ_CREATE indicates either that a user-mode protected subsystem, possibly on behalf of an application or subsystem-specific driver, has requested a handle for the file object associated with the target device object, or that a higher-level driver is connecting or attaching its device object to the target device object. 
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="drvrrtns_64du.htm"><I>DispatchClose</I></A><I> </I>
<P>IRP_MJ_CLOSE indicates that the last handle of the file object that was associated the target device object has been closed and released. All I/O requests have been completed or canceled, so there are no outstanding references to the file object pointer. 
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="drvrrtns_7s4y.htm"><I>DispatchRead</I></A><I> </I>
<P>IRP_MJ_READ indicates an I/O request to transfer data from the underlying physical device to the system. 
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="drvrrtns_6mr6.htm"><I>DispatchWrite</I></A><I> </I>
<P>IRP_MJ_WRITE indicates an I/O request to transfer data from the system to the underlying physical device. 
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="drvrrtns_0zoy.htm"><I>DispatchDeviceControl</I></A><I> </I>
<P>IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL indicates a request that contains a system-defined, device-type-specific I/O control code specifying a device type-specific operation. Higher-level drivers pass these IRPs on to their underlying device drivers, which typically process the request by accessing the device. 
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="drvrrtns_0cvm.htm"><I>DispatchInternalDeviceControl</I></A><I> </I>
<P>IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL indicates a request sent to the device driver, in most cases from a closely coupled higher-level driver, usually with a privately defined, driver-specific and device-type-specific or device-specific I/O control code requesting a device-type-specific or device-specific operation. 

<P>Only certain kinds of drivers are required to handle system-defined internal device I/O control requests, including certain SCSI drivers, keyboard or mouse device drivers, and parallel drivers that interoperate with system-supplied drivers. 
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="drvrrtns_9v76.htm"><I>DispatchSystemControl</I></A><I> </I>
<P>IRP_MJ_SYSTEM_CONTROL is used to specify WMI requests to drivers. For more information about WMI, see <A HREF="wmi_2lk7.htm">Windows Management Instrumentation</A>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>The dispatch routines that a driver must provide vary according to the type and functionality of the underlying physical device. For device-type-specific information about IRP major function codes that drivers must handle, see the device-type specific documentation in this DDK.</P>
