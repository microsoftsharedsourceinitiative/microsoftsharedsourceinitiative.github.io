<P>Each driver should support any <I>standard blocks</I> defined for drivers of its type. Standard blocks provide WMI clients with consistent data for all devices of a given type, regardless of vendor. </P>

<P>To support a standard block, a driver:

<UL>
	<LI>Registers the block with WMI, along with the other standard and custom blocks supported by the driver, as described in <A HREF="wmi_1hd3.htm">Registering as a WMI Data Provider</A>.</LI>

	<LI>Handles all WMI requests that specify the driver's device object pointer at <B>Parameters.WMI.ProviderId</B> and the GUID of the standard block at <B>Parameters.WMI.DataPath</B>, as described in <A HREF="wmi_9d47.htm">Handling WMI Requests</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>MOF classes for standard blocks are published in system-supplied MOF files. A driver must not redefine a standard block in its own MOF file, because doing so would duplicate the block in the WMI database. </P>

<P>Currently, class definitions of standard blocks are published in the file <I>wmicore.mof</I>, which is included in this DDK.</P>
