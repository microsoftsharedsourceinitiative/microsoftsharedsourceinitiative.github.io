<P>A driver's <A HREF="drvrrtns_7s4y.htm"><I>DispatchRead</I></A> and <A HREF="drvrrtns_6mr6.htm"><I>DispatchWrite</I></A> routines handle IRPs with I/O function codes of <A HREF="k113_7fhu.htm">IRP_MJ_READ</A> and <A HREF="k113_45o2.htm">IRP_MJ_WRITE</A>, respectively. Alternatively, a combined <A HREF="drvrrtns_7lbm.htm"><I>DispatchReadWrite</I></A> routine can handle IRPs for both of these I/O function codes.</P>

<P>Every driver of a device from which data can be transferred to the system must have a <I>DispatchRead</I> routine. Every driver of a device to which data can be transferred from the system must have a <I>DispatchWrite</I> routine. Any driver that transfers data in both directions can have a combined <I>DispatchReadWrite</I> routine.</P>

<P>Lower-level drivers handle IRP_MJ_READ and IRP_MJ_WRITE requests asynchronously. Therefore, <I>DispatchRead</I> and/or <I>DispatchWrite</I> routines in highest-level drivers must pass these requests on for further processing, provided that the request has valid parameters in that driver’s I/O stack location of the IRP. </P>

<P>Whether a driver sets up its device objects for buffered or direct I/O affects how it handles transfer requests. In particular, a driver that uses direct I/O to do DMA operations might need to split up large transfer requests into a sequence of smaller transfer operations in order to satisfy an IRP_MJ_READ or IRP_MJ_WRITE request. For more information, see <A HREF="iputoput_92cn.htm">Input/Output Techniques</A>.</P>

<P>The following subsections discuss some of the design and implementation considerations for <I>DispatchReadWrite</I> routines in lowest-level device drivers that use buffered I/O and direct I/O, as well as in higher-level drivers layered above them.</P>
