<P>For a multifunction device on a PnP ISA, USB, or 1394 bus, the parent bus driver enumerates the individual functions if the device conforms to the bus standard.</P>

<P>For such a device, the parent bus driver manages the fact that there is more than one device residing at a single bus location. To the rest of the system, the individual functions operate like independent devices. </P>

<P>Vendors of this type of multifunction device must do the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Ensure that the device conforms to the specification for the bus on which the device will reside.</LI>

	<LI>Provide a PnP function driver for each function of the device.
<P>Since the system-supplied bus driver handles the multifunction semantics, the function drivers can be the same drivers that are used when the functions are packaged as individual devices.
</LI>

	<LI>Provide an INF file for each function of the device.
<P>The INF files can be the same files that are used when the functions are packaged as a individual devices. The INF files do not need any special multifunction semantics.
</LI>
</UL>
