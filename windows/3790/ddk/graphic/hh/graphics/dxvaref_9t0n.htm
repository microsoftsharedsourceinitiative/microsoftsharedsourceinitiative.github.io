</DD>

<DT><B>dwMB_SNL</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of skipped macroblocks to be generated following the current macroblock and indicates the location of the residual difference data for the blocks of the current macroblock. This member contains two variables: <I>MBskipsFollowing</I> in the most significant 8 bits, and <I>MBdataLocation</I> in the least significant 24 bits. <I>MBskipsFollowing</I> indicates the number of skipped macroblocks to be generated following the current macroblock. <I>MBdataLocation</I> is an index into the residual difference block data buffer. This index indicates the location of the residual difference data for the blocks of the current macroblock, expressed as a multiple of 32 bits.</DD>

<DT><B>wPatternCode</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates whether <A HREF="dxvaguide_531j.htm">residual difference data</A> is sent for each block in the current macroblock. 

<P>Bit (11–<I>i</I>) of <B>wPatternCode</B> (where bit zero is the least significant bits) indicates whether residual difference data is sent for block <I>i</I>, where <I>i</I> is the index of the block within the macroblock as specified in MPEG-2 figures 6-10, 6-11, and 6-12 (raster-scan order for Y, followed by 4:2:0 blocks of Cb in raster-scan order, followed by 4:2:0 blocks of Cr, followed by 4:2:2 blocks of Cb, followed by 4:2:2 blocks of Cr, followed by 4:4:4 blocks of Cb, followed by 4:4:4 blocks of Cr). The data for the coded blocks (those blocks having bit (11–<I>i</I>) equal to 1) is found in the residual coding buffer in the same indexing order (increasing <I>i</I>). For 4:2:0 MPEG-2 data, the value of <B>wPatternCode</B> corresponds to shifting the decoded value of the CBP (coded block pattern) to the left by six bit positions (those lower bit positions being used for 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 chroma formats).


<P>If the <B>bConfigSpatialResidInterleaved </B>member of DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode is 1, host-based residual differences are sent in a chroma-interleaved form matching that of the YUV pixel format in use. In this case, each Cb and spatially corresponding Cr pair of blocks is treated as a single residual difference structure unit. This does not alter the value or meaning of <B>wPatternCode</B>, but it implies that both members of each pair of Cb and Cr data blocks are sent whenever either of these data blocks has the corresponding bit set in <B>wPatternCode</B>. If the bit in <B>wPatternCode</B> for a particular data block is zero, the corresponding residual difference data values must be sent as zero whenever this pairing necessitates sending a residual difference data block for a block with a <B>wPatternCode</B> bit equal to zero.
</DD>

<DT><B>wPC_Overflow </B></DT>

<DD>Specifies which blocks of the macroblock use overflow residual difference data.

<P>When using host-based residual difference decoding with the <B>bPicOverflowBlocks</B> member of <A HREF="dxvaref_9oyv.htm">DXVA_PictureParameters</A> equal to 1 and <I>IntraMacroblock</I> equal to zero (the 8-8 overflow method), <B>wPC_Overflow</B> contains the pattern code of the overflow blocks. (The pattern code is specified in the same manner as for <B>wPatternCode</B>.) The data for the coded overflow blocks (those blocks having bit (11–<I>i</I>) equal to 1) is found in the residual coding buffer in the same indexing order (increasing <I>i</I>).
</DD>

<DT><B>dwReservedBits2</B></DT>

<DD>Reserved bits used for packing and alignment. Must be zero.</DD>

<DT><B>MVector</B></DT>

<DD>An array containing the value of the motion vector(s) for the macroblock, each motion vector is represented by a <A HREF="dxvaref_6693.htm">DXVA_MVvalue</A> structure.

<P>Each skipped macroblock specified by <I>MBskipsFollowing </I>must be generated in a manner mathematically equivalent to incrementing the value of <B>wMBaddress</B> and then repeating the same macroblock control command.</P>

<P>The content of a macroblock control command with a nonzero value for <I>MBskipsFollowing</I> is equivalent (except for the value of <I>MBskipsFollowing</I>) to the content of the first of the series of skipped macroblocks. Thus, whenever <I>MBskipsFollowing</I> is not zero, the following structure members and variables must all be equal to zero: <I>Motion4MV, IntraMacroblock, </I><B>wPatternCode</B><I>, and </I><B>wPC_Overflow</B>. Each subsequent skipped macroblock is then generated in the same way as the first, except for incrementing the value of <B>wMBaddress</B>.</P>

<P><I>MBdataLocation</I> must be zero for the first macroblock in the macroblock control command buffer. For macroblocks other than the first macroblock in the macroblock control command buffer, <I>MBdataLocation</I> may contain any value if <B>wPatternCode</B> is zero. When <B>wPatternCode</B> is zero, decoders are recommended but not required to set this value either to zero or to the same value as in the next macroblock control command.</P>

<P>For more information on how skipped macroblocks are generated, see <A HREF="dxvaguide_17l3.htm">Generating Skipped Macroblocks</A>.</P>

<P>Valid combinations of <I>IntraMacroblock</I>, <I>MotionForward</I>, <I>MotionBackward</I>, <I>MotionType</I>, <I>MvertFieldSel</I>, and <B>MVector</B> are shown in the tables in <A HREF="dxvaguide_9wyv.htm">First Part of Macroblock Control Command Structure</A>.</P>
