<P>The following figure shows the video miniport driver within the NT-based operating system graphics subsystem.</P>

<P>Each video miniport driver provides hardware-level support for a display driver. The display driver calls the graphics engine <A HREF="gdifncs_1607.htm"><B>EngDeviceIoControl</B></A> function to request support from the underlying video miniport driver. <B>EngDeviceIoControl</B>, in turn, calls an I/O system service to send the request through the video port driver to the miniport driver.</P>

<P>In most circumstances, the display driver carries out time-critical operations that are visible to the user, while the underlying miniport driver provides support for infrequently requested operations or for truly time-critical operations that cannot be preempted by an interrupt or a context switch to another process.</P>

<P>A display driver cannot handle device interrupts, and only the miniport driver can set up device memory and map it into a display driver's virtual address space.</P>

<P>The video port driver is a system-supplied module provided to support video miniport drivers. It acts as the intermediary between the display driver and video miniport drivers</P>
