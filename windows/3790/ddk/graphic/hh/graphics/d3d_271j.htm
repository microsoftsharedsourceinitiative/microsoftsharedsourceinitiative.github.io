<P>The Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;2000 and later and Windows 98/Me Direct3D® DDI types are not directly compatible when they are compiled, because of naming differences and some type changes of structure and function members in each DDI type. For more information, see <A HREF="ddraw_0t5z.htm">Data Type Mapping between Windows 2000/XP and Windows 9x/98/ME</A>. Logically however, equivalent members in each DDI type serve the same purpose.</P>

<P>If your code will be portable between Windows&nbsp;2000 and later and Windows&nbsp;98/Me, use <I>dx95type.h</I>, a utility file that is included in the Windows DDK. It contains type definitions and macros that map some naming differences that occur between the Windows&nbsp;98/Me and Windows&nbsp;2000 and later platforms, enabling common driver code to be used between them.</P>
