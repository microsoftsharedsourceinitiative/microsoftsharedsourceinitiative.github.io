<P>DirectDraw provides two members in its surface structures in which drivers can store any data they want. These fields are the <B>dwReserved1</B> member in the surface global structure (<A HREF="ddstrcts_5mw7.htm">DDRAWI_DDRAWSURFACE_GBL</A>) and the <B>dwDriverReserved</B> member in the surface global more structure (<A HREF="ddstrcts_42ef.htm">DDRAWI_DDRAWSURFACE_GBL_MORE</A>). Given a local surface pointer (<I>lpddSurfLcl</I>, for example), the first field can be accessed as in the following expression: </P>

<PRE>lpddSurfLcl-&gt;lpGbl-&gt;dwReserved1</PRE>

<P>Accessing the second field is more complex, so the <B>GET_LPDDRAWSURFACE_GBL_MORE</B> macro from <I>ddrawi.h</I> should be used as follows: </P>

<PRE>GET_LPDDRAWSURFACE_GBL_MORE(lpddsurfLcl-&gt;lpGbl)-&gt;dwDriverReserved</PRE>

<P>The <B>dwReserved1</B> member is available for driver use for display memory surfaces only. The driver should not read from or write to this field if the surface is in system memory. This is not normally an issue because system memory surfaces are not usually seen by the driver. However, Direct3D drivers see system memory texture surfaces and DirectDraw drivers capable of system-to-display memory transfers can also be passed system memory surfaces. </P>

<P>If a driver must store information with a surface regardless of whether it is in system or display memory, it should use the new <B>dwDriverReserved</B> member. Note that a driver is not notified of the creation or destruction of system memory surfaces, so dynamically allocated resources should not be referenced by the <B>dwDriverReserved</B> member. The exception to this is system memory texture surfaces in Direct3D drivers. A Direct3D driver gets create and destroy texture calls in its HAL for system memory surfaces, and uses these entry points to dynamically allocate and free resources. </P>
