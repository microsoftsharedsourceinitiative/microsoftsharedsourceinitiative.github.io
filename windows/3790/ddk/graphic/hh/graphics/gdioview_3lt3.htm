<P>The driver exports only one function to GDI: <A HREF="ddifncs_9go7.htm"><B>DrvEnableDriver</B></A>. All other driver-supported functions, including the <A HREF="ddifncs_8xlz.htm"><I>DrvDisableDriver</I></A> function, are exposed to GDI through an array of pointers. A GDI call to <B>DrvEnableDriver</B> initializes the driver and passes back the list of driver-supported graphics DDI functions. While there are some functions a driver must support, GDI will handle those operations not included in the function list received from the driver’s <B>DrvEnableDriver</B> routine. GDI calls <I>DrvDisableDriver</I> when the driver is to be unloaded. Graphics DDI functions are discussed in depth in <A HREF="ddioview_5pk7.htm">Using the Graphics DDI</A>.</P>

<P>GDI makes a large number of objects and services available to the driver. These fall into two categories: user objects and service routines.</P>
