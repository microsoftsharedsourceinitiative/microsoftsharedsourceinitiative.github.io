<P>If you are using <A HREF="cpsui_1c4n.htm">CPSUI-supported window controls</A> in conjunction with <A HREF="cpsui_2wbr.htm">CPSUI-supplied pages and templates</A>, CPSUI provides window control resources that describe the controls in a manner that allows them to fit together. Therefore, you do not need to provide resources for the controls.</P>

<P>On the other hand, if you are creating a property sheet page that does not use a CPSUI-supplied page or template, you must customize the CPSUI-supported window controls that you use. To do this, you need to provide window control resources for the <A HREF="cpsuifnc_6tk7.htm">CPSUI option types</A>. You must specify identifiers for these resources using the <B>BegCtrlID</B> member of each option's <A HREF="cpsuifnc_0js7.htm">OPTTYPE</A> structure.</P>

<P>If you are customizing CPSUI-supported window controls, remember that CPSUI does not display an option if the OPTIF_HIDE flag set in the <A HREF="cpsuifnc_48mf.htm">OPTITEM</A> structure. CPSUI moves the remaining controls to fill the space normally taken up by the hidden option. Therefore, if you are creating a page containing several simultaneously-displayed options, the following rules should be obeyed:

<UL>
	<LI>Each option should occupy the entire horizontal space of the property sheet page.</LI>

	<LI>Option dialogs should not overlay each other.</LI>

	<LI>For options represented by radio buttons that are arranged from left to right, buttons and icons should be aligned on the <I>x</I> axis. If the buttons are arranged from top to bottom, buttons and icons should be aligned on the <I>y</I> axis.</LI>

	<LI>If several items share one group box, the group box must belong to the first <A HREF="cpsuifnc_48mf.htm">OPTITEM</A>, which is the topmost item in the group box. The group box must be large enough to contain all items associated with it.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Also, note that if radio buttons and icons are arranged top to bottom and some of these controls are hidden, CPSUI does not remove resulting white space in the <I>y</I> direction.</P>
