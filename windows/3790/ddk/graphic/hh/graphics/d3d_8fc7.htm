<P>The DirectX 9.0 version driver for a display device that supports pixel or vertex shader version 2.0 and later must indicate that it supports the following capabilities:</P>

<P>If a device supports vertex shader 2.0 and later, its driver must set the members of the D3DCAPS9 structure to the following values:

<UL>
	<LI>Set the <B>MaxStreams</B> member to be at least 8 to indicate that the device can handle 8 or more concurrent data streams.</LI>

	<LI>Set the D3DDTCAPS_UBYTE4 bit in the <B>DeclTypes</B> member to 1 to indicate support of the UBYTE4 vertex element type. For more information, see <A HREF="d3d_0wfb.htm">Reporting Support of UBYTE4 Vertex Element</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>If a device supports pixel shader 2.0 and later, its driver must configure the following bits in the <B>TextureCaps</B> member to indicate whether the driver supports 2-D texture mapping as nonpowers-of-2 conditionally or unconditionally. For more information, see the description of these bits in the <A HREF="d3dstrct_1rtz.htm">D3DPRIMCAPS</A> reference page.

<UL>
	<LI>Set the D3DPTEXTURECAPS_POW2 and D3DPTEXTURECAPS_NONPOW2CONDITIONAL bits to 1 to indicate conditional support. </LI>

	<LI>Set the D3DPTEXTURECAPS_POW2 and D3DPTEXTURECAPS_NONPOW2CONDITIONAL bits to 0 (that is, do not set these bits) to indicate unconditional support. </LI>
</UL>
