<P class=proch><B><IMG SRC="../images/wedge.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>To ensure that a DirectX driver  works correctly with DirectX DLLs</B>

<OL>
	<LI>Ensure that all file names provided with the device driver are unique to the vendor, as described in <A HREF="ddraw_2e93.htm">Naming Windows 98/Me Device Drivers</A>.</LI>

	<LI>Ensure that the device driver version number is correct for the Microsoft Windows® version and DirectX version, as described in the section <A HREF="ddraw_32uf.htm">Ensuring Correct Version Numbers</A>.</LI>

	<LI>Ensure that your DirectX driver is registered by completing Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) testing and acceptance, as described in <A HREF="ddraw_9dev.htm">Testing and Registering DirectX Device Drivers</A>.</LI>
</OL>

<P>DirectX Setup does not recognize an installed driver as newer unless it is registered and versioned as a DirectX driver.</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A "registered" driver is one for which the driver has been tested and accepted by WHQL with additional testing for DirectX compatibility. An "unregistered" driver is one that has not been tested and accepted by WHQL for DirectX compatibility. A registered DirectX driver is one that is provided by Microsoft or that has successfully passed WHQL testing, including validation that the driver correctly provides a version number as described in this topic.</P>
