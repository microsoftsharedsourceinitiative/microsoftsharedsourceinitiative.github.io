<P>The MPEG-1 video standard is titled ISO/IEC 11172-2. This standard was developed after H.261 and borrowed significantly from it. The MPEG-1 standard does not have a loop filter. Instead, it uses a simple half-sample filter that represents a finer accuracy of movement between frames than the full-sample accuracy supported by H.261. </P>

<P>Two additional prediction modes, bidirectional and backward prediction, were added. These prediction modes require one additional reference frame to be buffered. The bidirectional prediction mode averages forward-predicted and backward-predicted prediction blocks. The arithmetic for averaging forward and backward prediction blocks is similar to that for creating a half-sampled interpolated prediction block. The basic structure is otherwise the same as H.261.</P>
