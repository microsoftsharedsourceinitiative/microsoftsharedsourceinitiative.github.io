<P>A driver reports the multi-sample capabilities of its associated hardware by specifying the number of samples per pixel for each surface format it reports. The <A HREF="ddstrcts_6wtj.htm">DDPIXELFORMAT</A> structure has been extended to include a structure called <B>MultiSampleCaps</B>. This structure has members that let the driver express the number of samples per pixel for both flip (fullscreen) and blt (windowed) multi-sampling. Each of these members is a WORD type in which each bit of the WORD value indicates support for a given number of samples per pixel. Hence, the driver can express support for several different sample counts with a single surface format entry.</P>
