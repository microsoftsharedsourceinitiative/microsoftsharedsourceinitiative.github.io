<P>The FLIPRECORD structure is not defined by DirectDraw, and its use is not strictly required. However, it contains all the information needed to perform a flip. It is used in the sample implementations of the <A HREF="ddfncs_1ktj.htm"><I>updateFlipStatus</I></A>, <A HREF="ddfncs_7s4n.htm"><I>getDisplayDuration</I></A>, <A HREF="ddfncs_90o7.htm"><I>Flip32</I></A>, and <A HREF="ddfncs_9gh3.htm"><I>WaitForVerticalBlank32</I></A> functions; these sample implementations are described in the Comments sections of these functions. </P>

<P>FLIPRECORD keeps track of when it is all right to let an operation proceed against a back buffer. When an operation is requested against the surface specified by the <B>fpFlipFrom</B> member, you need to check the rest of the structure. The <B>liFlipTime</B> member is not needed if a bit exists to tell you when the refresh has occurred. The duration of a flip, in performance ticks, (<B>dwFlipDuration</B>) is not needed in this case either. If <B>liFlipTime</B> is needed, is set with the Win32 <B>QueryPerformanceCounter</B> function, which sets the beginning flip time and the future comparisons that determine the time elapsed. Likewise, if <B>dwFlipDuration</B> is needed, it is set when <I>getDisplayDuration</I> is called at mode change. </P>

<P>The <B>bFlipFlag</B> member keeps track of when a flip has been requested on a surface (setting this flag to TRUE indicates a pending flip). It is changed in <I>updateFlipStatus</I> and <I>WaitForVerticalBlank32</I>, based on the algorithm that determines whether a surface being flipped to has finished being displayed. If the flip has been requested, but the surface has not yet been through a refresh cycle, <B>bFlipFlag</B> is set to TRUE. The <B>bHaveEverCrossedVBlank</B> (filled in by the IN_VBLANK macro), <B>bWasEverInDisplay</B> (filled in by the IN_DISPLAY macro), and <B>dwFlipScanLine</B> (filled in by the CURRENT_VLINE macro) members are all involved in the algorithm that times a flip to avoid tearing (as explained in the <I>updateFlipStatus</I> reference section). The macros just mentioned are implementation-specific. </P>
