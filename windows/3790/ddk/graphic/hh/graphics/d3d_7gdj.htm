<P>The DirectX 9.0 runtime sends a <B>GetDriverInfo2</B> request using the <A HREF="d3dstrct_2ucn.htm#ddk_d3dgdi2_type_getadaptergroup_gg">D3DGDI2_TYPE_GETADAPTERGROUP</A> value to a DirectX 9.0 version driver to request the identifier for the group of adapters that make up the driver's multiple-head video card. The driver returns the identifier in the <B>ulUniqueAdapterGroupId</B> member of a <A HREF="d3dstrct_7t47.htm">DD_GETADAPTERGROUPDATA</A> structure. The driver must provide a unique identifier for the master and all subordinate adapters within a group. The runtime uses this identifier in subsequent operations to determine whether the given adapter is part of a group. This identifier must be unique across drivers, including drivers from other hardware vendors. Therefore, it is recommended to report this identifier as a unique nonzero kernel-mode address that cannot be common with other multiple-head video cards.</P>

<P>A DirectX 9.0 version driver indicates how its multiple-head hardware is configured by setting the following members of the D3DCAPS9 structure: 

<UL>
	<LI><B>NumberOfAdaptersInGroup</B>
<P>Specifies the number of adapters in the adapter group (only if master). This is 1 for single-head cards (conventional adapters). The value is greater than 1 for the master adapter of a multiple-head card. The value is 0 for a subordinate adapter of a multiple-head card. Each card can have at most one master, but can have many subordinates.
</LI>

	<LI><B>MasterAdapterOrdinal</B>
<P>Specifies the number for the master adapter in the group. This number is relevant if the system contains more than one multiple-head card. For example, if the system contains a single-head card, a double-head card, and a triple-head card, the system references the heads as:  0 for the single, 1 and 2 for the double, and 3, 4, and 5 for the triple. In this case, the master adapter is:  0 for the single, 1 for the double, and 3 for the triple. 
</LI>

	<LI><B>AdapterOrdinalInGroup</B>
<P>Specifies a number that indicates the order in which heads in a group are referenced by the driver. This value is always 0 for the master adapter and numbered consecutively for each subordinate adapter (that is, 1, 2, and so on). 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>The driver returns a D3DCAPS9 structure in response to a <B>GetDriverInfo2</B> query similarly to how it returns a D3DCAPS8 structure as described in <A HREF="d3d_0r6v.htm">Reporting DirectX 8.0 Style Direct3D Capabilities</A>. Support of this query is described in <A HREF="d3d_052f.htm">Supporting <B>GetDriverInfo2</B></A>. </P>
