<P>Surfaces can be <I>complex</I>, which means that they are part of a larger collection of associated surfaces. Examples of complex surfaces include the front buffer and associated back buffers, the various levels of a MIP map, and the various faces of a cube map.</P>

<P>The DirectDraw runtime uses a concept known as <I>surface attachments</I> to manage the linking of different simple surfaces into complex surfaces. Surfaces can be attached implicitly, as when the application makes one call to <B>IDirectDraw7::CreateSurface</B> to build a flipping chain (front buffer and back buffers with a possible Z-buffer); or explicitly, as when the application associates a Z-buffer with a render target by calling <B>IDirectDrawSurface7::AddAttachedSurface</B>. </P>
