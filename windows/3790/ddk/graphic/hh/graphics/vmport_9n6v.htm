<P>The miniport driver should call the following video port driver-supplied functions to enable its device to access main memory:

<OL>
	<LI>Call <A HREF="vpfncs_9b53.htm"><I>AgpReservePhysical</I></A> to reserve a range of physical addresses on the system bus to which the AGP controller can respond.</LI>

	<LI>Call <A HREF="vpfncs_9gkn.htm"><I>AgpCommitPhysical</I></A> to lock physical memory and have it mapped to a portion of the AGP-decodable physical address range returned by <I>AgpReservePhysical</I>. The miniport driver can call <I>AgpCommitPhysical</I> several times to do many smaller commitments rather than one large one.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Then, for an application to be able to see and use this committed AGP-controlled memory, the video miniport driver must call the following functions:

<OL>
	<LI>Call <A HREF="vpfncs_4h47.htm"><I>AgpReserveVirtual</I></A> to reserve a range of virtual addresses in the application's address space.</LI>

	<LI>Call <A HREF="vpfncs_40br.htm"><I>AgpCommitVirtual</I></A> to lock virtual memory and have the virtual addresses mapped to the AGP-decodable physical address range returned by <A HREF="vpfncs_9b53.htm"><I>AgpReservePhysical</I></A>.</LI>
</OL>

<P>An application can access committed virtual memory as if it were contiguous.</P>
