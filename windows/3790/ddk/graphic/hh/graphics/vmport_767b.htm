<P>Beginning with Windows XP, the operating system graphics interface supports DMA on PCI bus-master devices. Video miniport drivers of PCI bus-master devices can implement the following types of DMA support using helper functions supplied by the video port driver:

<UL>
	<LI><B>Packet-based DMA</B>
<P>In packet-based DMA, data is transferred directly between the requester's space and the device. Since the requester's space might not be contiguous, packet-based DMA is more efficient on those devices with hardware scatter/gather support. Packet-based DMA is an ideal choice for moving large amounts of arbitrary data between user space and the device.
</LI>

	<LI><B>Common-buffer DMA</B>
<P>In common-buffer DMA, a buffer is shared between (hence, common to), and used by both the host and the device for repeated DMA operations. Some drivers use common-buffer DMA to upload driver-manipulated data, such as a series of commands, to the graphics engine. The common buffer is contiguous and is always accessible to both the device and the host CPU. 

<P>The common buffer is a precious system resource. For better overall driver and system performance, drivers should use common-buffer DMA as economically as possible.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>Depending on the nature of the bus-master adapter, some miniport drivers use packet-based DMA exclusively, others use common-buffer DMA exclusively, and some use both.</P>

<P>Regardless of which type of DMA is used, the miniport driver should call <A HREF="vpfncs_45d3.htm"><B>VideoPortGetDmaAdapter</B></A> to get a pointer to the <A HREF="vstrcts_15if.htm">VP_DMA_ADAPTER</A> structure and use it for subsequent DMA functions calls. When there is no longer any need for continued DMA operations, the miniport driver should call <A HREF="vpfncs_8ppj.htm"><B>VideoPortPutDmaAdapter</B></A> to discard the adapter object.</P>

<P>The following subsections describe how to use the packet-based and common-buffer DMA support supplied by the video port driver.</P>
