<P>This information presented in this topic is separated into two parts: the first part is intended for those developing Windows&nbsp;98/Me drivers; the second part is intended for those developing Windows&nbsp;2000 and later drivers.</P>

<H4>Windows&nbsp;98/Me</H4>

<P>The kernel-mode video transport provides helper functions that allow Windows&nbsp;2000/WDM-style kernel-mode drivers to take advantage of VGA capabilities. These include various video port related features, the ability to reliably access the VGA frame buffer, and the ability to flip an overlay. This functionality is accessed by the kernel-mode driver linking with <I>dxapi.lib</I>, which allows it to later call <I>dxapi.sys</I>. This functionality is available only when DirectDraw is loaded. </P>

<P>The <A HREF="ddfncs_7puv.htm"><B>DxApi</B></A> function is the single entry point that accepts a function identifier, an input buffer and size, and an output buffer and size. The behavior of this function and the size and format of the input and output buffers depend on the specified function identifier.</P>

<P>To use the DxApi interface, the kernel-mode driver must receive ring 3 handles for each DirectDraw object, surface, and video port that it must use. For the capture and MPEG models, these handles are passed down using their existing APIs. If a driver wants to use this functionality but it has not been passed these handles already, a ring 3 component can retrieve the handles and pass them down to the driver.</P>

<H4>Windows 2000 and Later</H4>

<P>Kernel-mode video transport functionality is accessed by the <A HREF="vmport_7a1z.htm">video miniport driver</A> linking with dxapi.lib, which allows it to later call dxapi.sys. This functionality is available only when DirectDraw is loaded. </P>

<P>A hardware decoder uses the <A HREF="ddfncs_7puv.htm"><B>DxApi</B></A> function supplied with kernel-mode DirectDraw to access the DxApi interface callback functions. The <B>DxApi</B> function is a single entry point that accepts a function identifier, an input buffer and size, and an output buffer and size. The behavior of this function and the size and format of the input and output buffers depend on the specified function identifier. The <B>DxApi</B> function and its function identifiers are defined in <I>ddkmapi.h</I>.</P>

<P>DirectShow or another client accesses the DxApi interface callback functions supplied by the video miniport driver through DirectDraw. The DxApi interface callback functions are defined in <I>dxmini.h</I>.</P>

<P>To use the kernel-mode video transport interface, the video capture driver (for the hardware decoder) must first receive user-mode handles for each DirectDraw object, surface, and VPE object that it needs to use. For the capture and MPEG models, these handles are passed down using their existing APIs. If a driver requires this functionality but is not a stream-class driver, a user-mode component can retrieve the handles using the <A HREF="ddfncs_7293.htm"><B>IDirectDrawKernel</B></A> and <A HREF="ddfncs_6wtj.htm"><B>IDirectDrawSurfaceKernel</B></A> COM interfaces and pass them down to the driver. The COM interfaces and their methods are identified in <I>ddkernel.h</I>.</P>
