<P>Microsoft® NT-based operating systems provide a robust graphics architecture in which third-party graphics hardware companies can easily integrate their video displays and printing devices. This section provides design guidelines for writing effective graphics drivers. It is broken down as follows:

<UL>
	<LI><B>Graphics Drivers</B>
<P>This section describes the Graphics Driver Interface (GDI) and Graphics Device Driver Interface (Graphics DDI). Design and implementation details that are common to both display and printing drivers are discussed.
</LI>

	<LI><B>Display and Video Drivers</B>
<P>This section describes the video display environment in NT-based operating systems, and provides design and implementation details for display and video miniport driver writers.
</LI>

	<LI><B>Printer Drivers and Spooler Components</B>
<P>This section describes the drivers and print spooler that make up the printing environment in NT-based operating systems. Sections within this part of the DDK specify how to provide customized driver and spooler components, so that new printer hardware and network configurations can be supported.
</LI>
