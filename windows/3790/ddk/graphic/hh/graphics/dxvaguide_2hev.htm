<P>An accelerator can be used in restricted operation, in which case it conforms to a <A HREF="dxvaguide_1e7b.htm">restricted profile</A>, or it can be used in nonrestricted operation, in which case it does not conform to a restricted profile.</P>

<H4>Restricted Operation</H4>

<P>The capabilities of an accelerator are defined according to which restricted profile it supports. An accelerator may support one or more restricted profiles.</P>

<P>Some restricted profiles are defined as subsets of the capabilities of other restricted profiles (for example, the MPEG2_A profile is a subset of the capabilities of the MPEG2_B profile). Accelerators that support a particular restricted profile must also support any restricted profile that is a subset of the profile being supported. For example, accelerators that support the MPEG2_B profile must also support the MPEG2_A profile. </P>

<H4>Nonrestricted Operation</H4>

<P>If in DirectX VA an accelerator is used without strict conformance to a restricted profile, the <B>wRestrictedMode</B> member of the <A HREF="dxvaref_446f.htm">DXVA_ConnectMode</A> structure must be set to 0xFFFF to indicate this lack of restriction.</P>

<P>All defined values of the <I>bDXVA_Func</I> variable are allowed.</P>
