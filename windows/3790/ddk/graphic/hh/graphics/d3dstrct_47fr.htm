<DD><B>DirectX 8.1 and earlier versions only.</B><BR>
Points to the <A HREF="ddstrcts_1vl4.htm">DD_SURFACE_LOCAL</A> structure that identifies the DirectDraw surface containing the command data. The <B>fpVidMem</B> member of the embedded <A HREF="ddstrcts_392f.htm">DD_SURFACE_GLOBAL</A> structure points to the buffer that contains state change and primitive drawing commands for the driver to process. Specifically, this buffer contains one or more <A HREF="d3dstrct_9w6f.htm">D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND</A> structures, each followed by a D3DHAL_DP2<I>Xxx</I> structure whose exact type is identified by D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND's <B>bCommand</B> member.<BR>
<B>DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.</B><BR>
In addition to the command-buffer functionality of DirectX 8.1 and earlier, can point to a response buffer that the driver returns. Specifically, this response buffer contains one or more <A HREF="d3dstrct_8xif.htm">D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSE</A> structures, each followed by either <A HREF="d3dstrct_5fon.htm">D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSEQUERY</A> structures or zero if the response token in the <B>bCommand</B> of D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSE is <A HREF="d3denum_0jon.htm#ddk_d3ddp2op_responsecontinue_gg">D3DDP2OP_RESPONSECONTINUE</A>.</DD>

<DT><B>dwReqVertexBufSize</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the minimum number of bytes that the driver must allocate for the swap vertex buffer. This member is valid only when the D3DHALDP2_REQVERTEXBUFSIZE flag is set. Drivers that do not support multi-buffering of vertex buffers should ignore this member.</DD>

<DT><B>dwReqCommandBufSize</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the minimum number of bytes that the driver must increase the swap command buffer by. This member is valid only when the D3DHALDP2_REQCOMMANDBUFSIZE flag is set. Drivers that do not support multi-buffering of command buffers should ignore this member.</DD>

<DT><B>lpdwRStates</B></DT>

<DD>Points to a render state array that the driver should update when it parses render state commands from the command buffer. The driver should update this array only when the D3DHALDP2_EXECUTEBUFFER flag is set in <B>dwFlags</B>. The driver should use the <A HREF="d3denum_0baf.htm">D3DRENDERSTATETYPE</A> enumerated types to update the appropriate element of the render state array. </DD>

<DT><B>dwVertexSize</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the size of each vertex, in bytes. This member forms a union with <B>ddrval</B>.</DD>

<DT><B>ddrval</B></DT>

<DD><B>DirectX 8.1 and earlier versions only.</B><BR>

<B>DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.</B><BR>
In addition to the error-offset functionality of DirectX 8.1 and earlier, can specify the total size, in bytes, of the outgoing response buffer or zero if the response buffer is empty of responses. This member specifies response-buffer information only when the <B>ddrval</B> member is set to D3D_OK for successful completion. If this member is nonzero, it indicates that previously submitted queries using the <A HREF="d3denum_0jon.htm#ddk_d3ddp2op_issuequery_gg">D3DDP2OP_ISSUEQUERY</A> operation completed and that responses to those queries are specified in <A HREF="d3dstrct_8xif.htm">D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSE</A> and <A HREF="d3dstrct_5fon.htm">D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSEQUERY</A> structures and available in the outgoing response buffer. Each D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSEQUERY is followed by the following data related to the query: <BR>
BOOL for D3DQUERYTYPE_EVENT <BR>
DWORD for D3DQUERYTYPE_OCCLUSION<BR>
<A HREF="d3dstrct_7u7b.htm">D3DDEVINFO_VCACHE</A> structure for D3DQUERYTYPE_VCACHE<BR>
The runtime parses the response buffer and updates its internal data structures.<BR>
If this member is zero and the <B>ddrval</B> member is set to D3D_OK, the runtime does not bother to check for responses to queries.
