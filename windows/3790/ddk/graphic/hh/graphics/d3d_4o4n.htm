<H2><A NAME="ddk_determining_the_vertex_buffer_data_format_gg"></A>Determining the Vertex Buffer Data Format</H2>

<P>To identify the format of the data in the vertex buffer, a driver should determine the following information:

<UL>
	<LI>The dimension of the textures (1D, 2D, 3D, or 4D)</LI>

	<LI>The components that are present in the FVF data</LI>

	<LI>The ordering of the components that are present</LI>
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="ddk_fvf_texture_dimension_gg"></A>FVF Texture Dimension</H4>

<P>The driver should determine the dimension of the textures from the D3DTEXTURETRANSFORMFLAGS texture coordinate count flags (D3DTTFF_COUNT<I>n</I>, described in the DirectX SDK documentation). The number of the count flag signals how many texture coordinates are present. Note that this does not necessarily equate to the dimension of the textures themselves, as explained in the following sections.</P>

<H4>Nonprojected Textures</H4>

<P>The following lists nonprojected textures:

<UL>
	<LI>D3DTTFF_COUNT1 indicates that the rasterizer should expect 1D texture coordinates. </LI>

	<LI>D3DTTFF_COUNT2 indicates that the rasterizer should expect 2D texture coordinates. </LI>

	<LI>D3DTTFF_COUNT3 indicates that the rasterizer should expect 3D texture coordinates. </LI>

	<LI>D3DTTFF_COUNT4 indicates that the rasterizer should expect 4D texture coordinates.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Projected Textures</H4>

<P>If projected textures are being used, the D3DTTFF_PROJECTED flag is set to indicate that the texture coordinates are to be divided by the last (COUNTth) element of the texture coordinate set. Thus, for a 2D projected texture, the count would be three, because the first two elements are divided by the third, resulting in two floats for a 2D texture lookup. That is, both D3DTTFF_COUNT2 and D3DTTFF_COUNT3 | D3DTTFF_PROJECTED reference a 2D texture. </P>



<H4><A NAME="ddk_fvf_vertex_data_components_gg"></A>FVF Vertex Data Components</H4>

<P>The driver determines which components are present by analyzing the flags specified in the <B>dwVertexType</B> member of the <A HREF="d3dstrct_47fr.htm">D3DHAL_DRAWPRIMITIVES2DATA</A> structure. The following table indicates the bit fields that can be set in <B>dwVertexType</B> and the components that they identify: </P>

<H4><A NAME="ddk_fvf_vertex_component_ordering_gg"></A>FVF Vertex Component Ordering</H4>

<P>Microsoft Direct3D® supplies the driver with vertex data whose components are ordered as shown in the following figure. Direct3D always sends <I>x,y,z, </I>and<I> w</I> values; the remaining data is sent only as required by an application. Note that this diagram assumes 2D texture coordinates, although 1D, 3D, and 4D textures are also valid for the latest Direct X release.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/fvf.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><B>Flexible Vertex Format</B></P>

<P>As shown in the preceding figure, vertex data consists of the following components:

<OL>
	<LI>Location (<I>x,y,z,w</I>) (required)
<P>The first vertex component is four D3DVALUEs that identify the position of the vertex. Direct3D always sets the D3DFVF_XYZRHW bit in <B>dwVertexType</B>.
</LI>

	<LI>Diffuse Color (optional).
<P>If present, this component is a D3DCOLOR value that specifies the diffuse color for this vertex. Direct3D sets the D3DFVF_DIFFUSE bit in <B>dwVertexType</B> when this component is present.
</LI>

	<LI>Specular Color (optional).
<P>If present, this component is a D3DCOLOR value that specifies the specular color for this vertex. Direct3D sets the D3DFVF_SPECULAR bit in <B>dwVertexType</B> when this component is present.
</LI>

	<LI>Texture Data (optional).
<P>This part varies based on the dimension of the texture. For each dimension in the texture, a D3DVALUE specifies each of the <I>u</I>, <I>v</I>, <I>w,</I> or <I>q</I> components (see explanation of <A HREF="#ddk_fvf_texture_dimension_gg">FVF Texture Dimension</A>). For example, if 2D nonprojected textures are being used, two D3DVALUEs per texture are needed to specify the vertex's <I>u,v</I> values for each texture up to eight textures total. The number of <I>u,v</I> pairs present is <I>n</I>, where <I>n</I> corresponds to the D3DFVF_TEX<I>n</I> flag set in <B>dwVertexType</B>. For example, if D3DFVF_TEX3 is set in <B>dwVertexType</B>, then three <I>u,v</I> pairs are supplied with each vertex.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>FVF data is always tightly packed; that is, no memory is wasted on components that are not explicitly specified in the vertex buffer. For example, when <B>dwVertexType</B> is (D3DFVF_XYZRHW | D3DFVF_TEX2), and the texture dimension is 2D, each vertex in the buffer consists of eight tightly packed D3DVALUEs. These specify the location (<I>x,y,z,w</I>) and texture coordinates for two textures (<I>tu<SUB>0</SUB>,tv<SUB>0</SUB>, tu<SUB>1</SUB>,tv<SUB>1</SUB></I>) as shown in the following figure:</P>

<P>In the preceding figure it is assumed that there are only two texture coordinates. The vertex data supplied to the driver is always transformed and lit. The driver never receives normals. All data in the FVF texture coordinate sets are single precision IEEE floats. For implementation details, see the <I>perm3</I> sample driver. For more information about FVF, see the DirectX SDK documentation. </P>
