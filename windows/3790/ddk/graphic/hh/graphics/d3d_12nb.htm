<P>Applications can direct a Direct3D device to render primitives using solid or patterned lines. Applications can also stretch a particular line pattern if the device supports repeating the pattern. The device's driver must set the D3DPMISCCAPS_LINEPATTERNREP flag to indicate that the device supports repeating a particular line pattern. How this flag is set depends on the DirectX version: 

<UL>
	<LI>For DirectX 7.0 and earlier, set this flag in the <B>dwMiscCaps</B> member of the <A HREF="d3dstrct_1rtz.htm">D3DPRIMCAPS</A> structure.</LI>

	<LI>For DirectX 8.0 and later, set this flag in the <B>PrimitiveMiscCaps</B> member of the D3DCAPS<I>Xx</I> structure, where <I>Xx</I> indicates the DirectX version (for example, D3DCAPS8 for version 8 and D3DCAPS9 for version 9). D3DCAPS8 and D3DCAPS9 are described in their respective versions of the DirectX SDK documentation. </LI>
</UL>

<P>When applications set the render-state value for the D3DRENDERSTATE_LINEPATTERN (or D3DRS_LINEPATTERN) render state, they can specify the number of times to repeat the line pattern by setting the <B>wRepeatFactor</B> member of the D3DLINEPATTERN structure. Applications can set this member to a maximum value of 65535 (16-bit value). However, hardware only supports a maximum of 255 (8-bit value). Therefore, a display driver must fail a request that attempts to set the line-pattern-repetition number to a value greater than 255 as an invalid request. D3DLINEPATTERN is described in the DirectX SDK documentation. </P>
