<P>This section describes the methods defined for the <B>CPixel</B> class. Method prototypes are defined in the <I>pixel.hpp</I> file. This file along with <I>pixel.cpp</I> and <I>pixlib.cpp</I> are in the DDK and are used to build the <I>PixLib.lib</I> support library. </P>

<P>Methods of the <B>CPixel</B> class are used to recover the layout of light-weight system memory mipmap textures. For example, only information about the top level of a light-weight mipmap texture is stored. However, the runtime uses <B>CPixel</B> class methods to calculate the locations of sublevels for this light-weight mipmap texture. Consequently, if a driver must copy a light-weight system memory mipmap texture to video memory, the driver can use the <B>CPixel</B> class methods to calculate the source texture's size and the offset to the source texture's sublevels. Alternatively, driver writers can implement their own code that calculates this size and sublevel offset. To ensure that the runtime and drivers recover the memory layout of light-weight system memory mipmap textures in the same manner, this code must follow the same rules as the <B>CPixel</B> class.</P>

<P>In order for your driver to use <B>CPixel</B> class methods, you must include the <I>pixel.hpp</I> file in your code and link to <I>PixLib.lib</I> when you build your driver.</P>
