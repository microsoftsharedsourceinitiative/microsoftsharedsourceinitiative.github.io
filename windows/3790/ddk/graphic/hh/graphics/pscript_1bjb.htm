<P>A caller can use <B>EnumFeatures</B> to retrieve a keyword list that contains currently supported driver features and all PPD features, in addition to the following, which Pscript treats as if they were features defined within PPD <B>*OpenUI</B>/<B>*CloseUI</B> structure keywords:</P>

<P class=indent1><B>*LeadingEdge</B></P>

<P class=indent1><B>*UseHWMargins</B></P>

<P>Pscript handles certain features in a special way. If more than one of <B>*Resolution</B>, <B>*SetResolution</B>, and <B>*JCLResolution</B> keyword appear in a PPD, they are merged into one standard feature. After merging, the feature’s keyword name will be “JCLResolution” if <B>*JCLResolution</B> appears first; otherwise it will be “Resolution”.</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some driver features (such as <B>%Mirroring</B>) are always supported, while other driver features are supported only under certain conditions. For example, when spooler EMF spooling is disabled on Windows 2000 and later operating system releases, the <B>%PageOrder</B> feature will not be supported. These unsupported driver features will not appear in the output keyword list of <B>EnumFeatures</B>.</P>

<P>For driver features, the keyword prefix "%" is included in the output. For PPD features, the keyword prefix "*" is <I>not</I> included in the output.</P>
