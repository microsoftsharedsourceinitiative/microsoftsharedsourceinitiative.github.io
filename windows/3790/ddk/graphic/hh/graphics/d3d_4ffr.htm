<P>When the driver's <A HREF="ddfncs_4yav.htm"><I>DrvGetDirectDrawInfo</I></A> function is called by the Microsoft® DirectDraw® runtime to initialize DirectDraw support, the driver must do the following to indicate its Microsoft® Direct3D® capabilities:

<UL>
	<LI>Set the DDCAPS_3D flag in the <B>ddCaps.dwCaps</B> member of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_17s7.htm">DD_HALINFO</A> structure to indicate that the driver's hardware has 3D acceleration.</LI>

	<LI>Set the DDSCAPS_<I>Xxx</I> flags in the <B>ddCaps.ddsCaps</B> member of the DD_HALINFO structure that describe the 3D capabilities of a driver's video memory surface. The flags are listed in the following table.</LI>
</UL>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=48%>Flag</TH>
<TH align=left width=52%>Meaning</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS_3DDEVICE</TD>
<TD width=52%>Indicates that a driver's surface can be used as a destination for 3D rendering.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS_TEXTURE</TD>
<TD width=52%>Indicates that a driver's surface can be used for 3D texture mapping.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>DDSCAPS_ZBUFFER</TD>
<TD width=52%>Indicates that a driver's surface can be used as a Z-buffer.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<UL>
	<LI>Set the <B>GetDriverInfo</B> member of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_17s7.htm">DD_HALINFO</A> structure to point to the driver's <A HREF="ddfncs_0yhz.htm"><I>DdGetDriverInfo</I></A> callback. The driver must also set the DDHALINFO_GETDRIVERINFOSET flag in the <B>dwFlags</B> member of the DD_HALINFO structure to indicate that it has implemented the <I>DdGetDriverInfo</I> callback.</LI>

	<LI>Allocate and initialize the members of the <A HREF="d3dstrct_1yjr.htm">D3DHAL_CALLBACKS</A> structure and return this structure in the <B>lpD3DHALCallbacks</B> member of the DD_HALINFO structure.</LI>

	<LI>Allocate and initialize the members of the <A HREF="d3dstrct_1s13.htm">D3DHAL_GLOBALDRIVERDATA</A> structure and return this structure in the <B>lpD3DGlobalDriverData</B> member of the DD_HALINFO structure.</LI>
</UL>

<P>To indicate that the driver is capable of working with Microsoft DirectX® 7.0, it should do the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Include the D3DDEVCAPS_DRAWPRIMITIVES2EX flag in the <B>dwDevCaps</B> member of the <A HREF="d3dstrct_278n.htm">D3DDEVICEDESC_V1</A> structure that is reported during Microsoft Direct3D® driver initialization. </LI>

	<LI>Respond to the GUID_Miscellaneous2Callbacks GUID in <I>DdGetDriverInfo</I> callback by setting the <B>GetDriverState</B>, <B>CreateSurfaceEx</B>, and <B>DestroyDDLocal</B> members of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_4k6f.htm">DD_MISCELLANEOUS2CALLBACKS</A> structure. These are set to point to the appropriate callbacks for the Direct3D driver and ORed in the <B>dwFlags</B> member with the DDHAL_MISC2CB32_CREATESURFACEEX, DDHAL_MISC2CB32_GETDRIVERSTATE, and DDHAL_MISC2CB32_DESTROYDDLOCAL bits, respectively.</LI>
</UL>

<P>After <A HREF="ddfncs_4yav.htm"><I>DrvGetDirectDrawInfo</I></A> returns, GDI calls the driver's <A HREF="ddfncs_0yhz.htm"><I>DdGetDriverInfo</I></A> callback several times for different GUIDs to complete the driver's initialization. The <I>DdGetDriverInfo</I> callback must respond to the following GUIDs to support Direct3D:

<DL>
<DT>GUID_D3DCallbacks3</DT>

<DD>The driver should allocate and initialize the members of the <A HREF="d3dstrct_7hyf.htm">D3DHAL_CALLBACKS3</A> structure and return this structure in the <B>lpvData</B> member of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_3ijr.htm">DD_GETDRIVERINFODATA</A> structure.</DD>

<DT>GUID_Miscellaneous2Callbacks</DT>

<DD>The driver should allocate and initialize the members of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_4k6f.htm">DD_MISCELLANEOUS2CALLBACKS</A> structure and return this structure in the <B>lpvData</B> member of the DD_GETDRIVERINFODATA structure.</DD>

<DT>GUID_D3DExtendedCaps</DT>

<DD>The driver should allocate and initialize the appropriate members of the <A HREF="d3dstrct_2zhj.htm">D3DHAL_D3DEXTENDEDCAPS</A> structure and return this structure in the <B>lpvData</B> member of the DD_GETDRIVERINFODATA structure.</DD>

<DT>GUID_ZPixelFormats</DT>

<DD>The driver should allocate and initialize the appropriate members of a <A HREF="ddstrcts_6wtj.htm">DDPIXELFORMAT</A> structure for every Z-buffer format that the driver supports and return these structures in the <B>lpvData</B> member of the DD_GETDRIVERINFODATA structure. The driver must respond to this GUID if it supports the <A HREF="d3denum_0jon.htm#ddk_d3ddp2op_clear_gg">D3DDP2OP_CLEAR</A> operation code in its implementation of <A HREF="d3dfncs_5usn.htm"><I>D3dDrawPrimitives2</I></A>.</DD>

<DT>GUID_D3DParseUnknownCommandCallback</DT>

<DD>The driver should store the pointer to the Direct3D runtime's <B>D3DParseUnknownCommand</B> callback. The pointer is passed to the driver in the <B>lpvData</B> member of the DD_GETDRIVERINFODATA structure. The driver's <A HREF="d3dfncs_5usn.htm"><I>D3dDrawPrimitives2</I></A> callback calls the <B>D3DParseUnknownCommand</B> callback to parse commands that the driver does not recognize.
</DD>
</DL>
