<P>Driver writers might be tempted to keep a pointer to the DirectDrawSurface data structures inside their private driver-side surface structures. However, this practice does not succeed on Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;2000 and later because access to DirectDraw kernel-side data structures is mediated through a management scheme that insulates these structures from user mode and from drivers. <A HREF="gdifncs_4qp3.htm"><B>EngLockDirectDrawSurface</B></A> provides a pointer to the structure that is valid until the <A HREF="gdifncs_7c4n.htm"><B>EngUnlockDirectDrawSurface</B></A> routine is called.</P>

<P>Outside of this lock/unlock pair, the structure is not guaranteed to reside, or even exist, at the same location. Additionally, these lock/unlock pairs impede performance. If the driver keeps its own copies of the surface structures, then the locks are not needed. Updates to data within the driver-side surface structures are made during low-frequency calls like <A HREF="d3dfncs_0gtj.htm"><I>D3dCreateSurfaceEx</I></A>. The result is that less code must be executed during high-frequency calls like <A HREF="d3dfncs_5usn.htm"><I>D3dDrawPrimitives2</I></A>.</P>
