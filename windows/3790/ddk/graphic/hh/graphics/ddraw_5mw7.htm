<P>In general, allocating as much display memory as possible to DirectDraw increases display performance and allows games and other DirectDraw applications to run faster, with a better quality visual image.</P>

<P>Usually, display cards have the pitch set to the width of the display so that no memory is wasted to the right (conceptually) of the front buffer. This leaves one scratch area at the conceptual bottom that can be used for other surfaces. Memory access is very straightforward in this case because one pointer can reference the entire area of accessible display memory. </P>

<P>If the pitch is greater than the width of the primary surface, memory to the conceptual right of the front buffer is wasted. This has to be reclaimed as a separate rectangular heap, regardless of whether the memory on the card is linear or rectangular. (Even if the memory is linear, some display drivers fix the pitch to speed up the blitter. Rather than rewrite the driver, the memory can simply be reclaimed as a separate heap.) </P>

<P class=note><B>Note for Windows 98/Me</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When DirectDraw is initiated, the non-DirectDraw specific portion of the display driver must be informed which memory is being used by DirectDraw, so it can avoid writing to that memory while DirectDraw is in use. This is required for DirectDraw compatibility, and is done in the non-DirectDraw specific portion of the display driver. </P>

<P class=note>When allocating memory for DirectDraw use, the virtual display driver (VDD) memory must be preserved to provide to MS-DOS®. Caches for Windows pens, fonts, brushes, and so on can also be preserved. By going through the non-DirectDraw specific portions of the display driver code to see where VDD memory is allocated, you can determine what memory can be used. For optimum performance, give Windows&nbsp;98/Me a little extra memory, for example 32 KB, and make sure the memory is aligned on a four-byte boundary. That resulting address is used for the display pointer to the scratch area (the <B>fpStart</B> member of the <A HREF="ddstrcts_90yv.htm">VIDEOMEMORY</A> structure in the sample code). </P>
