<P>When the spooler calls <B>LoadLibrary</B> to load a print monitor DLL, the system immediately calls the DLL’s <I>DllEntryPoint</I> function. It is generally a good idea for the entry point function to call <B>DisableThreadLibraryCalls</B>, described in the Platform SDK documentation, so the DLL is not unnecessarily notified when threads are created and deleted.</P>

<P>Each DLL exports an initialization function, which the spooler calls after calling <B>LoadLibrary</B>. Language monitor DLLs and port monitor server DLLs export an <A HREF="spoolfnc_4m5j.htm"><B>InitializePrintMonitor2</B></A> function. Port monitor UI DLLs export an <A HREF="spoolfnc_3nzb.htm"><B>InitializePrintMonitorUI</B></A> function.</P>

<P>These two initialization functions are responsible for returning pointers to the rest of the <A HREF="provider_2s9z.htm">functions defined by print monitors</A>, so the spooler can call them. The initialization functions can also perform load-time initialization operations. The monitor's <B>InitializePrintMonitor2</B> function returns a monitor instance handle. The monitor should allocate local memory to store instance-specific information, and use the monitor handle as an identifier for the allocated memory.</P>

<P>When the spooler is first started, it loads all of the monitor DLLs that have been installed. After calling all monitor initialization functions, the spooler calls each port monitor’s <A HREF="spoolfnc_56w7.htm"><B>EnumPorts</B></A> function, which enumerates the ports supported by the monitor. (A monitor supports a port if the port has been added to the monitor’s database, as described in <A HREF="provider_6aef.htm">Adding a Port</A>.) Each supported port is then opened, as described in <A HREF="provider_3s4n.htm">Opening and Closing a Port</A>.</P>
