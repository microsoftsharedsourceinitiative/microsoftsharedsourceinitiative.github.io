<P>When an application calls CPSUI's <A HREF="cpsuifnc_15pj.htm"><B>ComPropSheet</B></A> function, specifying a function code of <A HREF="cpsuifnc_29ev.htm">CPSFUNC_SET_RESULT</A>, CPSUI calls all registered <A HREF="cpsuifnc_6qp3.htm">PFNPROPSHEETUI</A>-typed functions, specifying a reason of PROPSHEETUI_REASON_SET_RESULT. When specifying this reason, CPSUI also supplies a SETRESULT_INFO structure.</P>

<P>The values contained in the structure's <B>hSetResult</B> and <B>Result</B> members are the <I>lParam1</I> and <I>lParam2</I> values, respectively, that were supplied to CPSUI's <B>ComPropSheet</B> function.</P>

<P>Each of the application's PFNPROPSHEETUI-typed functions is called in order, from the one most recently declared to the first one declared, until one of these functions provides a return value of less than one. At that point, CPSUI returns from its <B>ComPropSheet</B> function, providing a count of the number of PFNPROPSHEETUI-typed functions that were called.</P>

<P>Typically, an application's PFNPROPSHEETUI-typed function sets the <B>Result</B> member of its PROPSHEETUI_INFO structure to the value received in the SETRESULT_INFO structure's <B>Result</B> member. Then the function returns a value of 1 (or greater), so the next PFNPROPSHEETUI-typed function can also receive it. Each subsequently called function is associated with a page that is the parent of the page associated with the last-called function. A function can modify the contents of SETRESULT_INFO structure's <B>Result</B> member, causing the functions associated with parent pages to receive the new value.</P>
