</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>D3DPRASTERCAPS_FOGTABLE</TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>D3DPRASTERCAPS_SUBPIXEL</TD>
<TD width=57%>The device performs subpixel placement of z, color, and texture data, rather than working with the nearest-integer pixel coordinate. This helps avoid bleedthrough due to z imprecision, and jitter of color and texture values for pixels. Note that there is no corresponding state that can be enabled and disabled; the device either performs subpixel placement or it does not, and this bit is present only so that the Direct3D client can better determine what the rendering quality is.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>D3DPRASTERCAPS_SUBPIXELX</TD>
<TD width=57%>The device is subpixel-accurate along the x-axis only, and is clamped to an integer y-axis scan line. For information about subpixel accuracy, see the previously mentioned definition of D3DPRASTERCAPS_SUBPIXEL.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=43%>D3DPRASTERCAPS_ZBUFFERLESSHSR</TD>
<TD width=57%>The device can perform hidden-surface removal (HSR) without requiring the application to sort polygons, and without requiring the allocation of a z-buffer. This leaves more video memory for textures. The method used to perform HSR is hardware-dependent and is transparent to the application. Z-buffer-less HSR is performed if no z-buffer surface is attached to the rendering target surface and the z-buffer comparison test is enabled (that is, when the state value associated with the D3DRENDERSTATE_ZENABLE render state value is set to TRUE).</TD>

If the <B>dwAlphaCmpCaps</B> member of the D3DPRIMCAPS structure is 0, the driver does not support alpha test render states D3DRENDERSTATE_ALPHAFUNC, D3DRENDERSTATE_ALPHAREF, and D3DRENDERSTATE_ALPHATESTENABLE.</DD>

<DT><B>dwShadeCaps </B></DT>

<DD>Specifies shading operations that the device can perform. It is assumed, in general, that if a device supports a given command (such as D3DOP_TRIANGLE) at all, it supports the D3DSHADE_FLAT mode (as specified in the D3DSHADEMODE enumerated type in the DirectX SDK documentation). This flag specifies whether the driver can also support Gouraud and Phong shading and whether alpha color components are supported for each of the three color-generation modes. When alpha components are not supported in a given mode, the alpha value of colors generated in that mode is implicitly 255. This is the maximum possible alpha (that is, the alpha component is at full intensity). 

<P>The color, specular highlights, fog, and alpha interpolants of a triangle each have capability flags that an application can use to find out how they are implemented by the device driver. These are modified by the shade mode and color model, and by whether the alpha component of a color is blended or stippled.

<TD width=48%>D3DPTEXTURECAPS_POW2</TD>

<TD width=48%>D3DPTEXTURECAPS_NONPOW2CONDITIONAL</TD>
<TD width=52%>Conditionally supports the use of two-dimensional (2D) textures (that is, not volume or cube textures) with dimensions that are not powers of 2. A device that exposes this capability can use such a texture if all of the following requirements are met. 
<UL>
	<LI>The texture addressing mode for the texture stage is set to D3DTADDRESS_CLAMP. </LI>

	<LI>Texture wrapping for the texture stage is disabled (D3DRS_WRAPn set to 0). </LI>

	<LI>Mipmapping is not in use (use magnification filter only).</LI>

	<LI>Texture was not stored in DXT1-5 (compressed texture formats).</LI>
</UL>

<P>A driver for a device that exposes this capability cannot perform dependent texture reads using such a texture. That is, such a texture cannot be addressed or sampled using texture coordinates that are computed with <A HREF="d3denum_0bhj.htm">shader code</A>. In other words, such a texture cannot be set at a stage that will be read based on a shader computation such as the bem, beml, or texm3x3 instructions in versions 1.0-1.3 of pixel shaders. For example, these textures can be used to store bump-map data that the driver supplies to texture reads, but not the environment maps that are used in texbem, texbeml, or texm3x3spec.</P>
