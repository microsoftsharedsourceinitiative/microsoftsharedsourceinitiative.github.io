<P>Microsoft® NT-based operating system display driver writers are concerned with two core software interfaces:

<UL>
	<LI>Graphics DDI interface — The set of functions that the display driver implements. GDI can call the graphics DDI interface to process graphics commands.</LI>

	<LI>GDI interface — System-supplied helper routines called by display drivers to simplify driver implementation.</LI>
</UL>

<P>This section describes key concepts associated with NT-based operating system display drivers as well as some implementation information. See <A HREF="gdioview_14br.htm">GDI Support for Graphics Drivers</A> and <A HREF="ddioview_5pk7.htm">Using the Graphics DDI</A> for graphics driver design details that are common to both printer drivers and display drivers, such as driver initialization and termination, and graphics output.</P>

<P>Display driver writers can also implement the following DDIs:

<UL>
	<LI>DirectDraw DDI — Graphics interface that allows vendors to provide hardware accelerations for DirectDraw. See <A HREF="ddraw_2yav.htm">DirectDraw</A> for details.</LI>

	<LI>Direct3D DDI — 3D graphics interface that allows vendors to provide hardware accelerations for Direct3D. See <A HREF="d3d_9eav.htm">Direct3D</A> for details.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For complete descriptions of the graphics DDI entry points and structures, as well as GDI service functions and objects, see <A HREF="ddifncs_2yav.htm">Graphics Driver Functions (DDI)</A>.</P>
