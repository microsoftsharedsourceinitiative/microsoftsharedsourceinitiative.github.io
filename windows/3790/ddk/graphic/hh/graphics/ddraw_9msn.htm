<P>The Microsoft® DirectDraw® Surface is the basic image unit in Microsoft DirectX® graphics. It is either a rectangular collection of pixels of a particular width, height, and pixel format; or a buffer containing commands or vertices for Microsoft Direct3D®. Surfaces have bits associated with them that denote their behavior and usage. These bits are called <I>surface capability bits</I> (or <I>caps bits</I> for short). Caps bits denote intended usages of their associated surfaces such as holding texels for rendering (the DDSCAPS_TEXTURE caps bit), being the target for 3D rendering (DDSCAPS_3DDEVICE), and many others. For more information on surface caps bits, see the <A HREF="ddstrcts_6zhj.htm">DDSCAPS</A> structure.</P>

<P>The <I>primary</I> surface is the surface that is currently being scanned out to the monitor by the display card. For more information on the primary surface, see the <A HREF="ddraw_44h3.htm">Flipping</A> and <A HREF="ddraw_7jtz.htm">Memory Configurations</A> sections. </P>
