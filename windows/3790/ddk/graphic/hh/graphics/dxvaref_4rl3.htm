</DD>

<DT><B>dwMB_SNL</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of skipped macroblocks to be generated following the current macroblock and indicates the location of the residual difference data for the blocks of the current macroblock. This member contains two variables: <I>MBskipsFollowing</I> in the most significant 8 bits and <I>MBdataLocation</I> in the least significant 24 bits. <I>MBskipsFollowing</I> indicates the number of skipped macroblocks to be generated following the current macroblock. <I>MBdataLocation</I> is an index into the IDCT residual difference block data buffer. This index indicates the location of the residual difference data for the blocks of the current macroblock, expressed as a multiple of 32 bits.</DD>

<DT><B>wPatternCode</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates whether residual difference data is sent for each block in the macroblock.

<P>Bit (11–<I>i</I>) of <B>wPatternCode</B> (where <I>i</I> is the index of the block within the macroblock and bit 0 represents the least significant bit) indicates whether residual difference data is sent for block <I>i</I> (See <A HREF="dxvaguide_531j.htm">Macroblock-Oriented Picture Decoding</A> for more information)<I>.</I> The value <I>i</I> is the index of the block within the macroblock as specified in MPEG-2 figures 6-10, 6-11, and 6-12 (raster-scan order for Y, followed by 4:2:0 blocks of Cb in raster-scan order, followed by 4:2:0 blocks of Cr, followed by 4:2:2 blocks of Cb, followed by 4:2:2 blocks of Cr, followed by 4:4:4 blocks of Cb, followed by 4:4:4 blocks of Cr). The data for the coded blocks (blocks having bit (11–<I>i</I>) equal to 1) is found in the residual coding buffer in the same indexing order (increasing <I>i</I>). For 4:2:0 MPEG-2 data, the value of <B>wPatternCode</B> corresponds to shifting the decoded value of CBP to the left by six bit positions (those lower bit positions being used for 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 chroma formats).


<P>If the <B>bConfigSpatialResidInterleaved </B>member of <A HREF="dxvaref_3vdz.htm">DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode</A> is 1, host-based residual differences are sent in a chroma-interleaved form matching that of the YUV pixel format in use. In this case, each Cb and spatially corresponding Cr pair of blocks is treated as a single residual difference data structure unit. This does not alter the value or meaning of <B>wPatternCode</B>, but it implies that both members of each pair of Cb and Cr data blocks are sent whenever either of these data blocks has the corresponding bit set in <B>wPatternCode</B>. If the bit in <B>wPatternCode</B> for a particular data block is zero, the corresponding residual difference data values must be sent as zero whenever this pairing requires sending a residual difference data block for a block with a <B>wPatternCode</B> bit equal to zero.
</DD>

<DT><B>bNumCoef</B></DT>

<DD>Each value in the <B>bNumCoef</B> array indicates the number of coefficients in the residual difference data buffer for each block <I>i</I> of the macroblock. 

<P>The array subscript <I>i</I> is the index of the block within the macroblock as specified in MPEG-2 video Figures 6-10, 6-11, and 6-12 (raster-scan order for Y, followed by Cb, followed by Cr). 


<P>This member is used only when the <I>HostResidDiff</I> flag (bit 10 in <B>wMBtype</B>) is zero and <B>bChromaFormat</B> is 1 (4:2:0). If used in 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 formats, it would increase the size of typical macroblock control commands past a critical memory alignment boundary. As a result, the <I>TCoefEOB</I> bit within the <A HREF="dxvaref_865j.htm">DXVA_TCoefSingle</A> structure is used for determining the number of coefficients in each block in non-4:2:0 cases.


<P>The purpose of <B>bNumCoef</B> is to indicate the quantity of data present for each block in the residual difference data buffer, expressed as the number of coefficients present. When the <B>bConfig4GroupedCoefs</B> member of the <A HREF="dxvaref_3vdz.htm">DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode</A> structure is 1, <B>bNumCoef</B> may contain either the actual number of coefficients sent for the block or that value rounded up to be a multiple of four. The data for these coefficients is found in the residual difference buffer in the same order.
</DD>

<DT><B>MVector</B></DT>

<DD>An array containing the value of the motion vector(s) for the macroblock, each represented using a <A HREF="dxvaref_6693.htm">DXVA_MVvalue</A> structure.
</DD>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>Each skipped macroblock specified by <I>MBskipsFollowing </I>must be generated in a manner mathematically equivalent to incrementing the value of <B>wMBaddress</B> and then repeating the same macroblock control command. Any macroblock control command with a nonzero value for <I>MBskipsFollowing</I> specifies how motion-compensated prediction is to be performed for each macroblock to be skipped, and is equivalent (except for the value of <I>MBskipsFollowing</I>) to an explicit nonskip specification of the generation of the first of the series of skipped macroblocks. Thus, whenever <I>MBskipsFollowing</I> is not zero, the following values must all be equal to zero: <I>Motion4MV</I>, <I>IntraMacroblock</I>, and <B>bNumCoef</B>.</P>

<P><I>MBdataLocation </I>is an index into the IDCT residual difference block data buffer, indicating the location of the residual difference data for the blocks of the current macroblock, expressed as a multiple of 32 bits. Must be zero for the first macroblock in the macroblock control command buffer. <I>MBdataLocation</I> may contain any value if <B>wPatternCode</B> is zero. When <B>wPatternCode</B> is zero, decoders are recommended but not required to set this value either to zero or to the same value as in the next macroblock control command.</P>

<P>Valid combinations of <I>IntraMacroblock</I>, <I>MotionForward</I>, <I>MotionBackward</I>, <I>MotionType</I>, <I>MvertFieldSel</I>, and <B>MVector</B> are shown in the tables in <A HREF="dxvaguide_9wyv.htm">First Part of Macroblock Control Command Structure</A>.</P>
