<P>GDI uses three RGB color spaces for its bitmap representations. In each of these color spaces, three bitfields, or <I>color channels</I>, are used to specify  the number of bits used for red, green, and blue, respectively, in a given color. To be able to match GDI's capabilities with bitmaps, video drivers must be able to convert from one RGB color space to another. </P>

<P>GDI recognizes the following RGB color spaces:

<UL>
	<LI>5:5:5 RGB: five-bit color channels for red, green, and blue</LI>

	<LI>5:6:5 RGB: a five-bit color channel for red, a six-bit color channel for green, and a five-bit color channel for blue</LI>

	<LI>8:8:8 RGB: eight-bit color channels for red, green, and blue</LI>
</UL>

<P>In general, when converting from a color channel with more bits to one with fewer bits, GDI discards the lower-order bits. When the conversion goes from a color channel with fewer bits to one with more bits, all of the bits of the smaller channel are copied to the larger channel. To fill out the remaining bits of the larger channel, some of the bits of the smaller channel are copied again to the larger channel. The following table summarizes the rules that GDI uses to convert from one RGB color space to another. In this table, color channels whose values change in the conversion are shown in <B>bold</B> font style.</P>
