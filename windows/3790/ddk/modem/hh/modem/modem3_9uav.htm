<P>The dial suffix should cause the modem to return to command state after dialing. The <A HREF="modemref1_9uwi.htm"><B>DialSuffix</B></A> entry is a string of characters (generally “;”) that is appended to any dial string before the terminator character string (generally "&lt;cr&gt;"). The following example shows how to set the <B>DialSuffix</B> value:</P>

<PRE>HKR, Settings, DialSuffix,, ";"
</PRE>

<P>Use a null <B>DialSuffix</B> if a dial suffix is not applicable. Use a null suffix for devices that inadvertently listen for dial tone at each dial command. The following example shows how to set the null <B>DialSuffix</B>:</P>

<PRE>HKR, Settings, DialSuffix,, ""
 </PRE>

<P>During staged dialing, several initialization strings are issued as Unimodem dial-out proceeds (for example, a number is dialed to get an outside line then another is dialed to connect, and so forth). Unimodem uses the dial suffix during its staged dialing process. </P>

<P>Some modem firmware contains a bug that causes a dial suffix to break all or part of any initialization that follows the dial suffix. Modem firmware that contains a dial suffix bug of this type should be fixed, even though it is possible to disable dial suffix as a workaround within an INF file. </P>

<P>To disable dial suffix, do not include the <A HREF="modemref1_9uwi.htm"><B>DialSuffix</B></A> entry in the INF file. If the dial suffix is disabled, the modem might not be able to dial long numbers or calling card numbers.</P>

<P>Some voice modems support staged dialing in data mode but not in voice mode. Set the flag in the <A HREF="modemref3_5ooi.htm"><B>VoiceProfile</B></A> entry if the dial string must always end with <B>DialSuffix</B> in voice mode. For more information about the VoiceProfile entry, see <A HREF="modem5_7gdj.htm">Adding Voice Support</A>.</P>
