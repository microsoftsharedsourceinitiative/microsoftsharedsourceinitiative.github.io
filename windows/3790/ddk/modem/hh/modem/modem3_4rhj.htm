<P>INF files for data modems are generally backward compatible across Microsoft Windows operating systems. Commands that are not supported by a particular version are transparent to the operating system. For example, newer INF registry entries, GUIDs, and most voice registry entries found in a modem INF file are transparent to earlier Windows operating systems that do not use these entries. In some cases, however, you will need to create a separate modem INF file version. Such an example is the case of INF files that are shipped with the operating system.</P>
