<P>You do not have to update a modem's hardware ID if you are:

<UL>
	<LI>Making updates to the modem firmware that do not affect the content of the modem INF file or the modem drivers.</LI>

	<LI>Adding features that are supported by applications but not directly supported by the operating system. In this case, distinct hardware IDs can still help applications identify modems that support these features.</LI>

	<LI>Distributing a modem through multiple PC manufacturers, where the end user is expecting the same name for the modem from all the manufacturers (for example, branding a bundled modem).</LI>
</UL>
