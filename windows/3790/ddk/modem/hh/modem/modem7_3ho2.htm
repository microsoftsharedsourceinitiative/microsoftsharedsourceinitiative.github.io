<P>Windows operating systems include modem INF files. Existing modem INF files are sometimes used as a template to create new INF files.</P>

<P>Follow these guidelines to avoid conflicts with other INF files:

<UL>
	<LI>Make sure that your modem ID strings are not already being used in another modem INF file. </LI>

	<LI>In the case of AC97, ensure that you are not using a device ID that another company currently uses for their device. Use Hardware ID's and not Compatible ID's in your INF file because Compatible ID's are common across this platform. </LI>

	<LI>Using a suitable search utility, search all pre-existing Windows modem INF files in your target Windows version for all of the modem IDs available from your new modem. You must check for all ID strings that may e present in the new modem. Change your modem ID strings if there are matches in the pre-existing INF files.</LI>

	<LI>Make sure that your new INF file contains only the entries that are necessary to support your new modem. Do not include entries for modems that are already included in the release of the Windows versions that you are targeting. </LI>

	<LI>Make sure that your new INF file will not be explicitly copied to the INF file directory. When a user is prompted for a disk or directory from which to install the new INF, Windows will automatically copy the new INF file to the correct location. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Before distributing your INF files:

<UL>
	<LI>Use the Microsoft test tools to test your modem installation. For more information about test tools, see <A HREF="modem7_2kyv.htm">Testing a Modem Installation</A><I>.</I></LI>

	<LI>Test your modem with any application software that you intend to distribute with the modem.</LI>

	<LI>To obtain support for your modem in future Windows operating systems, send a modem submission to Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL). Your submission should include your modem INF file and hardware. For more information about WHQL, see <A HREF="modem7_2kyv.htm">Testing a Modem Installation</A><I>.</I></LI>
</UL>
