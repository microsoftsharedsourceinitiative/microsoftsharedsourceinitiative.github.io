<P>Windows cannot recognize an upgraded modem as such unless the modem's hardware ID has been updated. If there is any need for the operating system to distinguish between non-upgraded and upgraded versions of a modem, these versions of the modem must have different hardware IDs. </P>

<P>You should update a modem's hardware ID if:

<UL>
	<LI>A modem is sold by various PC manufacturers, each of which requires its own manufacturer and model name strings. </LI>

	<LI>The display name of the modem has changed, for example, if a new PC OEM is distributing the modem.</LI>

	<LI>The command strings have changed, for example, if there are new initialization strings that support an upgrade.</LI>

	<LI>The response strings are new or have changed, for example, if V.90 connect responses have been added.</LI>

	<LI>A hardware change requires a new driver, for example, if a different digital signal process has been introduced.</LI>

	<LI>An upgrade includes new features supported by the operating system.</LI>

	<LI>An upgrade includes new features supported by applications and these applications use the hardware ID to verify that the device supports these features.</LI>
