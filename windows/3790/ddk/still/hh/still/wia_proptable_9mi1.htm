<P>The WIA_IPS_ROTATION property contains the current rotation setting. It is used for fine tuning when adding rotation to the initial setting of the WIA_IPS_ORIENTATION property. Values of the WIA_IPS_ROTATION property range from zero through 359 degrees. The value of the WIA_IPS_ORIENTATION property is the starting position for applying rotation. The minidriver creates and maintains this property. For further information, see the <A HREF="wia_proptable_9t7t.htm">WIA_IPS_ORIENTATION</A>.</P>

<P>As an example, setting the WIA_IPS_ORIENTATION property to LANDSCAPE and the WIA_IPS_ROTATION property to 15 results in the final image being rotated 15 degrees clockwise relative to landscape orientation.</P>

<P>The WIA minidriver is responsible for rotating the image data before sending it back to the application. The application is responsible for checking the image headers to see the newly rotated values.</P>

<P>There is considerable confusion about resolving the effect of rotation and orientation on the current image selection area (which is defined by the <A HREF="wia_proptable_817t.htm">WIA_IPS_XPOS</A>, <A HREF="wia_proptable_4wtl.htm">WIA_IPS_YPOS</A>, WIA_IPS_XEXTENT, and <A HREF="wia_proptable_0e95.htm">WIA_IPS_YEXTENT</A> properties). Extent settings should be adjusted only when the WIA_IPS_ORIENTATION property is set. This is the starting selection area of the intended image. The <A HREF="wia_proptable_00tl.htm">WIA_IPA_PIXELS_PER_LINE</A> and <A HREF="wia_proptable_7961.htm">WIA_IPA_NUMBER_OF_LINES</A> properties should reflect the current extent settings only (which should represent the proper orientation setting). These properties also remain consistent with the original image selection area.</P>

<P>The WIA_IPS_ROTATION property should be applied after considering the image selection area. A change in rotation has an effect on the output image dimensions, so these must be reflected in the resulting image’s data header. The <A HREF="wia_proptable_9t7t.htm">WIA_IPS_ORIENTATION</A> and WIA_IPS_ROTATION properties are additive. The original image selection area is modified by WIA_IPS_ORIENTATION as it is downloaded to the device by the WIA driver, and represents the orientation of the paper being scanned. The value of the WIA_IPS_ROTATION property is then applied to the captured image to yield the final image header information that is reported to the application during data transfer. </P>

<P>One possible reason for combining these two values is to use them to cancel each other. For instance, some scanners with automatic document feeders may receive a performance benefit from describing a WIA_IPS_ORIENTATION of LANDSCAPE in combination with a WIA_IPS_ROTATION of 90 degrees. This allows the user to feed images in landscape orientation (which lets them feed more quickly), but rotates the captured images back to portrait (which is the way the user typically wants to view them).</P>
