<P>As described previously, properties are stored in WIA driver items. A driver item is a logical description of the still image device and the data stored or produced by the device. A WIA minidriver creates a WIA driver item, using the functions from the WIA service library.</P>

<P>A WIA driver usually has more than one driver item. The first driver item, which is required, is a logical representation of the still image device, and is called the <I>root item</I>. The root item contains those properties that describe the characteristics and settings of the physical still image device. </P>

<P>The following diagram is an example of a root item.</P>

<P>A still image device must also describe the data stored or produced by the device. For example, a camera can store many images (or other media formats) on its media. Each image can have information such as a unique name and the dimensions of the image. The WIA minidriver model allows this information to be stored by the driver in items called <I>child items</I>. A child item contains the properties that describe the characteristics of the data it represents.</P>

<P>The following diagram is an example of a child item.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/wia_childdriveritem.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><B>WIA Minidriver Child Item</B></P>

<P>Similar to the directory hierarchy found in modern file systems consisting of directories and files, the WIA minidriver model stores root and child items in a hierarchy referred to as an <I>item tree</I>. A WIA minidriver uses the WIA services library to create root and child driver items that logically describe the device and its data. In the case of digital still camera devices, or any still image device that stores more than one image, the item tree resembles a directory structure with one root item and many child items.</P>

<P>The following diagram is an example of an item tree created by a minidriver for a digital still camera.</P>

<P>In the case of a simple flatbed scanner device, or any still image device that does not have storage, the item tree contains only one child item. Microsoft recommends that the child item be named in a way that specifically identifies the device. For example, a flatbed scanner acquires its data from the scanner bed; therefore the child item should be named “Flatbed.”</P>
