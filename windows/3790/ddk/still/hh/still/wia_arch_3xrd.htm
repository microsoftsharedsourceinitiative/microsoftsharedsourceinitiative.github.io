<P>WIA is comprised of several layers that intercede between the user and the hardware. The user interacts with the WIA application, which can have optional user interfaces. This application communicates with the WIA service, which sends the user's requests on to the minidriver. The minidriver communicates with the relevant kernel-mode bus driver. Finally, the bus driver communicates with the hardware. The following diagram illustrates the software components that comprise the WIA interface. </P>

<H4>Imaging Applications</H4>

<P>Imaging applications do not communicate directly with the minidriver, but communicate with the WIA service through the WIA Application Programming Interface (WIA API) to access images and acquire data from WIA devices. These applications can use the system-supplied user interface (UI), or one supplied by the device's manufacturer. The UI is used to select items for transfer and to set relevant properties. Note that it is the application, not the driver, that transfers the selected items after the UI is dismissed. For more information on the WIA API for imaging applications, see the Platform SDK documentation.</P>

<H4>WIA Service</H4>

<P>The WIA service is a system-supplied component that communicates with imaging applications and WIA minidrivers. It is a collection of the COM interfaces listed in the following table, all of which are described in the Platform SDK documentation. The WIA service executes in a separate process from applications, but in the same process as WIA minidrivers. Applications direct device requests to the WIA service. The WIA service then directs these requests to the appropriate minidriver, through a WIA Device Driver Interface (WIA DDI).  The DDIs that the WIA service could use consist of the following:</P>

<H4>WIA Driver Services Library</H4>

<P>The <A HREF="wia_arch_7m09.htm">WIA driver services library</A> is a system-supplied component that provides helper functions for WIA minidrivers. A minidriver can call helper functions to perform tasks such as the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Initialize the <A HREF="wia_arch_64dl.htm">WIA driver item tree</A>.</LI>

	<LI>Read, write and validate device properties.</LI>

	<LI>Transfer data.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Alternatively, a minidriver can perform such tasks itself. By taking advantage of the helper functions, you can reduce development time and the size of a WIA minidriver, while still having the flexibility to develop individual solutions.</P>

<H4>WIA Utility Library</H4>

<P>The <A HREF="wia_arch_41m1.htm">WIA Utility Library</A> includes a collection of debugging functions (<B>wiauDbg<I>Xxx</I></B>), a collection of general utility helper functions, and three classes: the <B>CWiauDbgFn</B> class, the <B>CWiauFormatConverter</B> class, and the <B>CWiauPropertyList</B> class.</P>

<H4>WIA Minidrivers</H4>

<P><A HREF="minidrv_9961.htm">WIA minidrivers</A> are vendor-supplied, user-mode components that direct WIA property changes and commands to an imaging device. A minidriver implements the WIA DDI, which is called by the WIA service to communicate with the minidriver.</P>

<P>A WIA minidriver provides a device-specific, user-mode interface to a kernel-mode still image driver, which drives the imaging device through a driver, such as a USB driver. A minidriver communicates with the kernel-mode drivers by calling the <B>CreateFile</B>, <B>ReadFile</B>, <B>WriteFile</B>, and <B>DeviceIoControl</B> Win32® functions (described in the Platform SDK documentation). </P>

<P>An imaging application cannot make direct calls to the WIA minidriver. Only the WIA service can call the driver directly.</P>

<H4>Kernel I/O Drivers</H4>

<P>Kernel-mode still image drivers are system-supplied or IHV-supplied components that package data for delivery to still image devices, and for transfer from still image devices. A kernel-mode still image driver is bus-specific.</P>

<P>Microsoft provides WDM-based kernel-mode still image drivers for the USB, SCSI, and IEEE 1394 buses. For more information, see <A HREF="wia_drv_basic_6pex.htm">Accessing Kernel-Mode Drivers for Still Image Devices</A>. </P>

<P>A vendor must provide a kernel-mode still image driver only if its imaging device is incompatible with Microsoft-supplied kernel-mode I/O drivers.</P>
