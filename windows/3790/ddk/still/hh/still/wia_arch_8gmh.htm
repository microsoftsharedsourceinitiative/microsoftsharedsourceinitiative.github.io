<P>WIA properties are attributes of either a device (the root) or an item (a child). Device properties contain information about the device, such as the manufacturer's name, a description of the device, and its type (scanner or camera). Item properties contain information about a particular item, such as the item's name, when it was captured, and so on. Device properties are identified by the WIA_D naming convention; item properties are identified by the WIA_I naming convention.</P>

<P>The three-letter acronym in the middle of a WIA property name contains information about the type of property: whether it is a generic device information property (DIP), a device property (DPA, DPC, or DPS), or an item property (IPA, IPC, or IPS). Device and item properties can be common to both types of devices (DPA and IPA), can be specific to cameras (DPC or IPC), or can be specific to scanners (DPS and IPS). The following table lists the various WIA property types and gives examples of each type.</P>
