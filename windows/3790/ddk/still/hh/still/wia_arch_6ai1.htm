<P>The main purpose of a WIA minidriver is to transfer data from the device to the application. In the case of a camera, the data may be previously captured pictures, audio, or video clips. In the case of a scanner, the device may need to transfer the data as it acquires it from the scanner.</P>

<P>WIA has two ways of transferring data from the device to the application. The first is in-memory transfer in which the device returns bands of image data to the WIA service. The second way is file transfer to the WIA service. Note that the WIA service receives the data and forwards it to the requesting application.</P>
