<P>A file data transfer is a transfer of image data from the WIA minidriver into a file created by the WIA service. The WIA application initiating the data transfer indicates to the WIA service that it is ready to perform a file transfer. </P>

<P>The WIA service then creates a file and instructs the WIA minidriver to transfer data into the file. The WIA minidriver contacts the device requesting the data to be transferred. The minidriver requires its own memory so the lower-level,-bus-driver stack is able to place the acquired data into the buffer. Upon receiving the data in its buffer, the WIA minidriver uses the <A HREF="wiasfncs_1ovd.htm"><B>wiasWriteBufToFile</B></A> WIA service library function, passing in its memory buffer. The WIA service library then writes the contents of this buffer into the file created by the WIA service, as shown in the following diagram.</P>
