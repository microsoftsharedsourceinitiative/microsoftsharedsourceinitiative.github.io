<P>This section describes the features of the system-supplied parallel drivers for parallel ports and devices that are attached to parallel ports.</P>

<P>Except for 64-bit versions of Microsoft® Windows®, Windows&nbsp;2000 and later provides a parallel port function driver and a parallel port bus driver for Plug and Play devices that are attached to a parallel port. Microsoft does not provide parallel drivers for 64-bit versions of Windows. </P>

<P>Windows&nbsp;2000 includes the following drivers:

<UL>
	<LI><I>Parclass</I> is the parallel port bus driver for devices that are attached to parallel ports. The executable image of Parclass is <I>parallel.sys</I>. </LI>

	<LI><I>Parport</I> is the parallel port function driver. The executable image of Parport is <I>parport.sys</I>. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The operation of Parclass and Parport is closely connected through <A HREF="cisspd_9uwi.htm">internal device control requests for parallel ports</A> and <A HREF="cisspd_3wky.htm">parallel port callback routines</A>.</P>

<P>In Windows&nbsp;XP and later, Parclass is removed, and Parport provides the function of both the parallel port function driver and the parallel port bus driver. The executable image of Parport in Windows&nbsp;XP is <I>parport.sys</I>.</P>

<P>The system-supplied function driver for parallel ports creates a functional device object (FDO) that represents each parallel port enumerated in the system. The system-supplied bus driver for parallel ports creates a physical device object (PDO) that represents each parallel device that the bus driver enumerates on a port. Clients, for example <A HREF="vspd_6aef.htm">vendor-supplied parallel drivers</A>, operate a parallel device through the interfaces provided by a parallel device's PDO and the FDO of the device's parent port.</P>

<P>Except for minor operational differences described throughout the parallel documentation, the <A HREF="cisspd_316a.htm">client interfaces to system-supplied parallel drivers</A> is the same in Windows&nbsp;2000 as in Windows&nbsp;XP and later.</P>

<P>The system-supplied parallel drivers support:

<UL>
	<LI>Legacy parallel ports, standard parallel port devices, IEEE 1284-compatible devices, IEEE 1284-compliant devices, and IEEE 1284.3 daisy chain devices</LI>

	<LI>Most communication modes, including Centronics mode, IEEE 1284 modes, extended capabilities port (ECP) mode, and enhanced parallel port (EPP) mode</LI>

	<LI>Plug and Play, power management, and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)</LI>

	<LI>Shared access to all the parallel ports installed on the system</LI>

	<LI>Raw access to all parallel devices</LI>

	<LI>IOCTLs and callbacks to operate parallel ports and devices — see <A HREF="sspd_3kiv.htm">IOCTL and Callback Support for Parallel Ports and Devices</A></LI>
</UL>

<P>The system-supplied parallel drivers provide the following <I>partial</I> support for IEEE 1284.3 devices:

<UL>
	<LI>A combination of device control requests and callback routines that is functionally equivalent to the <I>Service Provider Interface</I>. See <I>Service Provider Interface (SPI)</I> in the IEEE P1284.3 specification.</LI>

	<LI>The selection and operation of more than one IEEE 1284.3 daisy chain device and an end-of-chain device<I>, as</I> defined in the <I>Daisy Chaining</I> clause of the IEEE P1284.3 specification.</LI>

	<LI>Basic services to support the data link layer, as specified in the <I>Data link layer </I>clause of the IEEE P1284.3 specification — see <A HREF="vspd_1o6f.htm">Connecting to an IEEE 1284.3 Data Link Device</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The system-supplied parallel drivers <I>do not support</I> the following IEEE 1284.3 specifications:

<UL>
	<LI>Multiplexors, as specified in the <I>Multiplexor</I> clause of the IEEE P1284.3 specification.
<P>There are no plans to support this feature in future releases of Windows.
</LI>

	<LI>Interrupts for IEEE 1284.3 daisy chain devices.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The system-supplied parallel drivers create:

<UL>
	<LI>Device objects, interfaces, and unprotected symbolic links, as described in <A HREF="sspd_3kpz.htm">Device Stacks for Parallel Ports and Devices</A>.</LI>

	<LI>A work queue for each parallel port.
<P>The system-supplied function driver for parallel ports queues I/O requests to allocate a parallel port and to select an IEEE 1284.3 device attached to a parallel port.
</LI>

	<LI>A worker thread and work queue for each parallel device.
<P>The system-supplied bus driver for parallel ports queues the following I/O requests if it cannot immediately complete them: read, write, device control, and internal device control.
</LI>
</UL>
