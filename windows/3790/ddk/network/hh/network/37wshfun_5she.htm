<H4>Parameters</H4>

<DL>
<DT><I>HelperDllSocketContext</I></DT>

<DD>Pointer to a per-socket context area, allocated and initialized by the WSH DLL <B>WSHOpenSocket </B>or <B>WSHOpenSocket2 </B>function.</DD>

<DT><I>SocketHandle</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies a handle to the socket that is the target of the requested operation.</DD>

<DT><I>TdiAddressObjectHandle</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the handle to a file object representing the open transport address for the socket. If the socket is not currently bound to an address, this parameter is NULL.</DD>

<DT><I>TdiConnectionObjectHandle</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the handle to a file object representing the connection endpoint associated with the socket. If the socket is not currently connected, this parameter is NULL.</DD>

<DT><I>IoControlCode</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies an SIO_<I>XXX</I> code requesting a specific operation. The following are possible system-defined <I>IoControlCodes</I>: 

<DL>
<DT>SIO_FIND_ROUTE</DT>

<DD>Requests that the route to this socket be determined. <I>InputBuffer</I> will be NULL. However, <I>OutputBuffer</I> must not be null.</DD>

<DT>SIO_FLUSH</DT>

<DD>Requests that the current contents of the send queue for the socket be flushed. <I>InputBuffer </I>and <I>OutputBuffer</I> will be NULL.</DD>

<DT>SIO_MULTIPOINT_LOOPBACK</DT>

<DD>Requests that, whenever data is sent on a multipoint session socket, the data also be sent to the socket on the local host if the data in <I>InputBuffer</I> is TRUE. Otherwise, the socket is requested to terminate that behavior.</DD>

<DT>SIO_MULTICAST_SCOPE</DT>

<DD>Sets, for the socket specified, wheter data sent on a multipoint sessions socket will cross routers. If the <I>InputBuffer</I> contains zero, no data should be sent except to multipoint session members on the local host. The value one indicates that no routers should be crossed. Values greater than one indicate that <I>n-1</I> routers may be crossed when data is sent.</DD>
</DL>


<P>A helper DLL also can define its own codes.
</DD>

<DT><I>InputBuffer</I></DT>

<DD>Pointer to an input buffer for the operation requested by the given <I>IoControlCode</I>.</DD>

<DT><I>InputBufferLength</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the length in bytes of the buffer at <I>InputBuffer</I>.</DD>

<DT><I>OutputBuffer</I></DT>

<DD>Pointer to an output buffer for the operation requested by the given <I>IoControlCode</I>. This buffer is used to return information or query results to the caller.</DD>

<DT><I>OutputBufferLength</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the length in bytes of the buffer at <I>OutputBuffer</I>.</DD>

<DT><I>NumberOfBytesReturned</I></DT>

<DD>On return, specifies the number of bytes copied into the buffer at <I>OutputBuffer</I>.</DD>

<DT><I>Overlapped</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies a pointer to a WSAOVERLAPPED structure to facilitate asynchronous I/O.</DD>

<DT><I>CompletionRoutine</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies a pointer to a WSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE provided by the caller.</DD>

<DT><I>NeedsCompletion</I></DT>

<DD>On output, specifies whether the service provider should perform I/O completion operations for overlapped requests.
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Return Value</H4>

<P><B>WSHIoctl </B>returns zero to indicate successful operation. Otherwise, it returns a Winsock Error code, as outlined in the following:

<DL>
<DT>WSAENETDOWN</DT>

<DD>Specifies that the network has failed.</DD>

<DT>WSAEFAULT</DT>

<DD>Specifies that one or more of the buffers at <I>InputBuffer</I> or <I>OutputBuffer</I> are too small for successful operation.</DD>

<DT>WSAEINVAL</DT>

<DD>Specifies that the <I>IoControlCode</I> is not a valid command or that a supplied parameter is invalid.</DD>

<DT>WSAEINPROGRESS</DT>

<DD>Specifies that <B>WSHIoctl</B> was called while there was a completion routine callback in progress. This error can be returned only if the helper DLL handles I/O completion of overlapped requests itself.</DD>

<DT>WSAEOPNOTSUPP</DT>

<DD>Specifies that a normally valid <I>IoControlCode</I> is inappropriate to this socket. This generally indicates that the requested operation is not supported by the underlying protocol.</DD>

<DT>WSA_IO_PENDING</DT>

<DD>Specifies that the request is still in progress and will be completed at a later time. This error code can be returned only if overlapped information has been supplied at <I>Overlapped</I> or <I>OverlappedRoutine</I>.</DD>

<DT>WSAEWOULDBLOCK</DT>

<DD>Specifies that this operation would block the socket but the socket has been marked as a non-blocking socket.
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P><B>WSHIoctl</B> is called by the service provider to satisfy several types of requests. In addition, it is possible for a helper DLL to support operations designated by privately defined I/O control codes specific to a protocol that the helper DLL supports. Such privately defined codes will be transmitted to the helper DLL by <B>WSAIoctl</B>. For more information on <B>WSAIoctl</B> or custom control codes, see the Platform SDK.</P>

<P>Because some operations that are normally requested through <B>WSHIoctl</B> can require a significant amount of time to complete, an overlapped I/O mechanism is provided. A caller either specifies a WSAOVERLAPPED structure in <I>Overlapped </I>or specifies a callback routine in <I>OverlappedRoutine</I>.</P>

<P>When such an I/O operation is completed, the helper DLL can either handle I/O completion in the overlapped manner itself, or allow the service provider to handle such operations. This is controlled by the <I>NeedsCompletion</I> parameter.</P>

<P>If the helper DLL chooses to handle the I/O completion itself, the following guidelines apply:

<UL>
	<LI>If a completion routine is specified in <I>OverlappedRoutine</I>, the structure provided at <I>Overlapped</I> should be ignored.</LI>

	<LI>If a completion routine is not specified, then the <I>Overlapped</I> parameter is used. The event handle provided in this structure should be signalled to indicate to the caller that the I/O has completed.</LI>

	<LI>When calling a completion routine provided at <I>OverlappedRoutine</I>, the number of bytes transferred, normally returned in <I>NumberOfBytesReturned</I> and an error code (zero indicating success) must be passed as the defined parameters to this caller-supplied I/O completion routine.</LI>
</UL>
