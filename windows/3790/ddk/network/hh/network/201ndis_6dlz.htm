<P>The DDK includes sample code for miniport drivers that manage several types of network cards. These sample drivers can be tailored to a driver developer’s needs. The sample drivers contain functions that can be adapted to a new but similar driver. There are always hardware-dependent functions that must be written by the driver developer. However, many functions are fairly standard. For example, functions that communicate with the NDIS Library instead of a network interface card are generally standard. For these driver functions, the code in a sample driver might be usable with little or no modification.</P>
