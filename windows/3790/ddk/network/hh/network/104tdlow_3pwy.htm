<P>The <I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> function is required. This function processes receive indications made by underlying driver(s) that call <A HREF="103ndisx_6f02.htm"><B>NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket</B></A>. </P>

<H4>Parameters</H4>

<DL>
<DT><I>ProtocolBindingContext</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the handle to a protocol-allocated context area in which the protocol driver maintains per-binding run-time state. The driver supplied this handle when it called <A HREF="103ndisx_9koi.htm"><B>NdisOpenAdapter</B></A>. </DD>

<DT><I>ProtocolVcContext</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the handle to a protocol-allocated context area in which this driver maintains per-VC run-time state. The client or stand-alone call manager supplied this handle either when it called <A HREF="103ndisx_3qia.htm"><B>NdisCoCreateVc</B></A> or from its <A HREF="104tdlow_299u.htm"><I>ProtocolCoCreateVc</I></A> function. </DD>

<DT><I>Packet</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies a pointer to a packet descriptor for the received net packet. NDIS extracted this pointer from an array of packet descriptor pointers that an underlying driver passed to <A HREF="103ndisx_6f02.htm"><B>NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket</B></A>. 
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Return Value</H4>

<P><I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> returns a driver-determined value that indicates to NDIS how many times this protocol must call <A HREF="103ndisx_61de.htm"><B>NdisReturnPackets</B></A> subsequently before NDIS can return the packet resources to the underlying driver that allocated these resources. </P>

<H4>Headers</H4>

<P>Declared in <I>Ndis.h</I>. Include <I>Ndis.h</I>.</P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>Any protocol driver that binds itself to an underlying connection-oriented NIC driver must have a <I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> function. Such an underlying miniport driver always indicates full-packet receives.</P>

<P><I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> must call the NDIS_GET_PACKET_STATUS macro once for each packet descriptor in the array pointed to by <I>Packet. </I>NDIS_GET_PACKET_STATUS obtains the OOB block <B>Status</B> associated with the packet descriptor.</P>

<P>If the underlying NIC driver, before calling <A HREF="103ndisx_6f02.htm"><B>NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket</B></A>, set the OOB block <B>Status</B> to NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS, the NIC driver temporarily relinquished ownership of the resources associated with the packet descriptor. In this case, the protocol (or the TDI clients of a highest level protocol) can hold on to all received data, to which it is given read-only access, specified at <I>Packet</I> if <I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> returns a nonzero value. For a highest level protocol that forwards the input <I>Packet</I> descriptor pointer to some number of interested clients, each client retains read-only access to the indicated data until the client calls <A HREF="33tdifun_67aq.htm"><B>TdiReturnChainedReceives</B></A>. A protocol driver retains ownership of the indicated packet until it calls <A HREF="103ndisx_61de.htm"><B>NdisReturnPackets</B></A> with <I>Packet</I> as many times as the reference count returned by <I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I>. </P>

<P>If <I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> does not call <B>NdisReturnPackets</B> itself, the protocol must pass the input <I>Packet</I> pointer to <B>NdisReturnPackets</B> after <I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> returns control. In this scenario, <I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> should save the input <I>Packet</I> pointer in the <I>ProtocolBindingContext</I> area when it will return a nonzero value. </P>

<P>The NDIS library maintains the reference count for such an indicated packet, and the protocol retains ownership of the packet until it has called <B>NdisReturnPackets</B> with that packet as many times as the value returned by its <I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> function. </P>

<P><I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> returns zero to relinquish ownership of the given <I>Packet</I> if the protocol has no current clients or bound higher level protocols interested in the indicated network packet or if the <I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> function copies the data from the given packet and associated out-of-band block, if any, to protocol-allocated storage itself. When ProtocolCoReceivePacket returns zero, NDIS either calls another bound protocol with the receive indication or returns the given packet descriptor at <I>Packet</I> to the miniport driver that made the indication. </P>

<P>When an underlying NIC does run short of resources, it sets a packet descriptor's associated OOB block <B>Status</B> to NDIS_STATUS_RESOURCES. This forces <I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> to copy the packet data immediately rather than retaining the NIC-driver-allocated packet resources. <I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> must return zero in such a situation.</P>

<P>If an underlying miniport driver supplies additional out-of-band information for receives, <I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> can retrieve the associated out-of-band information for the given <I>Packet</I> with the appropriate NDIS_GET_PACKET_<I>XXX</I> macro(s). </P>

<P><I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> must be written so that it can run at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL. </P>
