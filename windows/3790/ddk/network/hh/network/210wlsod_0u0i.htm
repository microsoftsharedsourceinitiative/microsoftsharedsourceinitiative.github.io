<P>As a set, the OID_WW_GEN_PING_ADDRESS OID requests an underlying miniport driver and its NIC to transmit a diagnostic packet for an echo-request operation to the specified node through the currently connected wireless network. The only intent of this OID is to allow protocols and applications to determine if two-way communications can be established to a remote node on the currently attached network. On some networks, additional functionality may be provided to detect if full end-to-end connectivity can be established. This OID is defined as OPTIONAL.</P>

<P>As a query, this OID requests the underlying miniport driver and its NIC to return information about the results of a previous echo-request operation to determine if a remote node was connected to a wireless network. </P>

<P>This request uses a WW_PING_ADDRESS structure, defined as follows:</P>

<PRE class=syntax>typedef struct _WW_PING_ADDRESS {
  <B>IN  </B>WW_ADDRESS_FORMAT  Format; 
  <B>IN  </B>NDIS_VAR_DATA_DESC  TargetAddress; 
  <B>OUT </B>UINT  uTime; 
} WW_PING_ADDRESS;
</PRE>

<P>The members of this structure contain the following information:

<DL>
<DT><B>Format</B></DT>

<DD>Address format of the remote node specified by <B>TargetAddress</B>. This address format must be one of the values contained in the WW_ADDRESS_FORMAT enumeration. The following lists the valid values. 

<DL>
<DT>WW_IEEE_ADDRESS</DT>

<DD>A 48-bit IEEE address in network byte order.</DD>

<DT>WW_MOBITEX_MAN_ADDRESS</DT>

<DD>A Mobitex access number in network byte order.</DD>

<DT>WW_DATATAC_RDLAP_ADDRESS</DT>

<DD>A DataTAC RDLAP address in network byte order.</DD>

<DT>WW_DATATAC_MDC4800_ADDRESS</DT>

<DD>A DataTAC MDC 4800 address in network byte order.</DD>

<DT>WW_DATATAC_RESERVED</DT>

<DD>Reserved by DataTAC networks.</DD>

<DT>WW_IPv4_ADDRESS</DT>

<DD>An IP version 4 address in network byte order.</DD>

<DT>WW_IPv6_ADDRESS</DT>

<DD>An IP version 6 address in network byte order.</DD>

<DT>WW_PROPRIETARY_ADDRESS</DT>

<DD>Address is specified in a proprietary format. The miniport driver must decode the format in which the address is represented. </DD>
</DL>


<P>If an incoming echo-request operation supplies anything other than one of the preceding values or if it supplies a value that the underlying driver does not support, the underlying driver returns NDIS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED.
</DD>

<DT><B>TargetAddress</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies a <A HREF="210wlsod_7sky.htm">NDIS_VAR_DATA_DESC</A> type that describes a buffer containing the station network address in use by the remote node. The miniport driver maps this address, which must be compatible with the value of <B>Format</B>, to a native address of the currently connected wireless network. The address in the buffer is represented in network byte order. 

<P>Broadcast or group addresses are invalid for this operation and the miniport driver should return NDIS_STATUS_INVALID_DATA. 
</DD>

<DT><B>uTime</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the length of time in milliseconds for the echo-request operation to complete. This operation requires the miniport driver to transmit a diagnostic packet to the remote node and then receive a response from the remote node. This member specifies the time that elapses between the transmission and response. A value of –1 represents an unsuccessful echo-request operation. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>Indications are irrelevant for this OID. </P>
