<P>A connectionless protocol driver calls <A HREF="103ndisx_0u42.htm"><B>NdisRequest</B></A> to retrieve (query) or set the characteristics of an underlying miniport driver. The type of information in the request is specified by an object identifier (OID). For a complete listing of general OIDs, see <A HREF="22genoid_1m2a.htm">General Objects</A>.</P>

<P>A connectionless protocol driver uses <A HREF="22genoid_55gy.htm">OID_GEN_MAXIMUM_FRAME_SIZE</A> to query the maximum frame size, in bytes, supported by an underlying miniport driver. The size returned does not include the packet header.</P>

<P>A connectionless protocol driver uses <A HREF="22genoid_7u9e.htm">OID_GEN_MAXIMUM_TOTAL_SIZE</A> to request an underlying miniport driver to report the largest packet that the miniport driver supports on the NIC that it manages. The protocol driver must restrict the size of the packets it subsequently sends to this size. It is an error for a protocol driver to submit a packet that is larger than the size supported by the underlying miniport driver.</P>

<P>A connectionless protocol driver should use <A HREF="22genoid_9roy.htm">OID_GEN_MAXIMUM_SEND_PACKETS</A> to determine the number of send packets that an underlying driver can accept each time the protocol calls <A HREF="103ndisx_88s2.htm"><B>NdisSendPackets</B></A>. For a discussion of how this request can affect the protocol driver’s subsequent send operations, see <A HREF="302pro_6prb.htm">Sending Protocol Driver-Originated Packets</A>.</P>

<P>A connectionless protocol driver can make a query request and a set request concerning the size of the lookahead data buffer that the underlying driver supplies whenever the protocol driver's <A HREF="104tdlow_62k2.htm"><I>ProtocolReceive</I></A> function is called. The OID used is <A HREF="22genoid_1jzm.htm">OID_GEN_CURRENT_LOOKAHEAD</A>. If the protocol driver issues this as a query request, NDIS returns the current lookahead buffer size for the given binding to the underlying miniport driver. If the protocol driver makes a set request with this OID code, this set request indicates the protocol driver's preferred lookahead buffer size, but the protocol driver is not assured that an underlying driver will conform to this request. </P>

<P>A connectionless protocol driver can query the underlying miniport driver for its link speed with <A HREF="22genoid_25pu.htm">OID_GEN_LINK_SPEED</A> and use the results to set any internal time-out values it maintains. If the protocol driver is bound to NDISWAN, it cannot determine the link speed until it receives a line-up indication from the WAN miniport driver, indicating that a connection has been established between the local node and a remote node.</P>

<P>A connectionless protocol driver must issue an <A HREF="22genoid_499u.htm">OID_GEN_MAC_OPTIONS</A> query to determine the operating characteristics of the underlying miniport driver. This query returns information such as, whether the underlying driver supports 802.1 priority.</P>

<P>If required, a connectionless protocol driver issues a set request to inform NDIS of its own operating characteristics, passing <A HREF="22genoid_18fm.htm">OID_GEN_PROTOCOL_OPTIONS</A>.</P>

<P>Protocol drivers should support 64-bit statistics OID query requests. In a statistics OID query request, the protocol driver sets the <B>InformationBufferLength</B> member of the <A HREF="105nstru_3f8y.htm">NDIS_REQUEST</A> structure to four (bytes) to indicate a 32-bit statistics request or to eight (bytes) to indicate a 64-bit statistics request. In its response, the miniport driver sets the <B>BytesNeeded</B> member to the size of the statistics supported by the miniport driver (four for 32-bits or eight for 64-bits). The miniport driver sets the <B>BytesWritten</B> member to the smaller of these two values: the <B>InformationBufferLength</B>, or the size of statistics supported by the miniport driver. For more information about statistics OIDs, see <A HREF="22genoid_73hu.htm">General Statistics</A>. </P>
