<P>When a kernel-mode client makes a TDI_QUERY_INFORMATION request, it asks the underlying TDI transport driver to return information of a client-specified type, such as a broadcast address, the transport's capabilities, or its current statistics for I/O on a particular connection. </P>

<H4>IRP</H4>

<P>The transport calls <B>IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation</B> with the given <I>Irp</I> to get a pointer to its own I/O stack location in the IRP, shown in the following list as <B>IrpSp</B>. The pointer to the IRP is shown in the following list as <B>Irp</B>. IRP members relevant to this request include the following:

<DL>
<DT><B>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the final status of the query-information request. The transport sets this member before it completes the IRP, possibly to one of the following:

<P>STATUS_SUCCESS<BR>
STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW<BR>
STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES<BR>
STATUS_INVALID_CONNECTION<BR>
STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST<BR>
STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
</DD>

<DT><B>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Information</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of bytes of information the transport is returning to its client. </DD>

<DT><B>IrpSp-&gt;MajorFunction</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL. The transport can ignore this member if it exports a <B>TdiDispatchInternalDeviceControl</B> routine that handles only TDI_<I>XXX</I> requests. </DD>

<DT><B>IrpSp-&gt;MinorFunction</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies TDI_QUERY_INFORMATION.</DD>

<DT><B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B></DT>

<DD>Pointer to an open file object representing an address, connection endpoint, or control channel. The transport uses the <B>FsContext</B> and, possibly, <B>FsContext2</B> fields to access the state it maintains about this address, connection endpoint, or control channel. </DD>

<DT><B>IrpSp-&gt;Parameters</B></DT>

<DD>Pointer to a TDI_REQUEST_KERNEL_QUERY_INFORMATION structure, defined as follows:

<PRE>struct _TDI_REQUEST_KERNEL_QUERY_INFO {<B> </B>
    LONG QueryType;<B> </B>
    PTDI_CONNECTION_INFORMATION RequestConnectionInformation;<B> </B>
} TDI_REQUEST_KERNEL_QUERY_INFORMATION, *PTDI_REQUEST_KERNEL_QUERY_INFORMATION;<B> </B></PRE>


<P>A transport can typically ignore the <B>RequestConnectionInformation</B> member because it is typically NULL. NetBIOS transports might require this member, as described later (see Comments). The transport checks the <B>QueryType</B> member to determine what information the client requested, which also determines the format of the information to be returned and, sometimes the client-supplied contents, of the buffer mapped at <B>Irp-&gt;MdlAddress</B>. 


<P>For every TDI transport, <B>QueryType</B> can be set to one of the following system-defined values: 


<DL>
<DT>TDI_QUERY_ADDRESS_INFO</DT>

<DD>Requests the transport to return information about a particular local-node address, formatted as a TDI_ADDRESS_INFO structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. 

<P><B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B> must point to a file object representing the address or to a connection endpoint already associated with the address for which to return the information. 
</DD>

<DT>TDI_QUERY_CONNECTION_INFO</DT>

<DD>Requests the transport to return information about a particular connection, formatted as a TDI_CONNECTION_INFO structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>.  

<P><B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B> must point to a file object representing the connection for which to return the information. 
</DD>

<DT>TDI_QUERY_BROADCAST_ADDRESS</DT>

<DD>Requests the transport to return a broadcast address, formatted as a TRANSPORT_ADDRESS structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. 

<P><B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B> must point to a file object representing a control channel. 
</DD>

<DT>TDI_QUERY_NETWORK_ADDRESS</DT>

<DD>Requests the transport to return a local-node address, formatted as a TRANSPORT_ADDRESS structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>.

<P><B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B> must point to a file object representing a control channel.
</DD>

<DT>TDI_QUERY_DATA_LINK_ADDRESS</DT>

<DD>Requests the transport to return the datalink address, formatted as a TRANSPORT_ADDRESS structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>.

<P><B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B> must point to a file object representing a control channel. 
</DD>

<DT>TDI_QUERY_PROVIDER_INFO or TDI_QUERY_PROVIDER_INFORMATION</DT>

<DD>Requests the transport to return information about its own capabilities, formatted as a TDI_PROVIDER_INFO structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. 

<P><B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B> must point to a file object representing a control channel. 
</DD>

<DT>TDI_QUERY_PROVIDER_STATISTICS</DT>

<DD>Requests the transport to return information about its resource usage, formatted as a TDI_PROVIDER_STATISTICS structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. 

<P><B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B> must point to a file object representing a control channel. 
</DD>

<DT>TDI_QUERY_DATAGRAM_INFO</DT>

<DD>Requests the transport to return information about its limits on size and number of datagrams, formatted as a TDI_DATAGRAM_INFO structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. 

<P><B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B> must point to a file object representing a control channel. A transport also can support this query on open transport addresses at the discretion of the transport writer. 
</DD>

<DT>TDI_QUERY_MAX_DATAGRAM_INFO</DT>

<DD>Requests the transport to return information about its limit on datagram size, formatted as a TDI_MAX_DATAGRAM_INFO structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. 

<P><B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B> must point to a file object representing a control channel. A transport also can support this query on open transport addresses at the discretion of the transport writer. 
</DD>
</DL>


<P>In addition to the preceding queries, which every TDI transport must support, a particular transport might support others. For example, NetBIOS transports also must respond to three additional system-defined TDI_QUERY_<I>XXX</I>, as described later (see Comments). 
</DD>

<DT><B>Irp-&gt;MdlAddress</B></DT>

<DD>Pointer to an MDL, possibly the initial MDL in a chain of MDLs, mapping a client-supplied buffer containing whatever client-supplied contents are required to carry out the request. The input contents and format of this buffer depend on the given <B>QueryType</B>. 
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Headers</H4>

<P>Declared in <I>TdiKrnl.h</I>. Include <I>TdiKrnl.h</I>.</P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>For any NetBIOS transport, <B>QueryType</B> also can specify one of the following:

<DL>
<DT>TDI_QUERY_FIND_NAME</DT>

<DD>Requests the NetBIOS transport to return the information, formatted as FIND_NAME_HEADER followed by FIND_NAME_BUFFER structures, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. For this query type, <B>RequestConnectionInformation</B> must point to a valid TDI_CONNECTION_INFORMATION structure. </DD>

<DT>TDI_QUERY_SESSION_STATUS</DT>

<DD>Requests the transport to return the information, formatted as SESSION_HEADER followed by SESSION_BUFFER structures, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. </DD>

<DT>TDI_QUERY_ADAPTER_STATUS</DT>

<DD>Requests the transport to return the information, formatted as an ADAPTER_STATUS structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. 

<P>For more information about the preceding NetBIOS-specific structures, see the Platform SDK. 

</DD>
</DL>

<P>In most cases, <B>TdiBuildQueryInformation</B> is the macro a client uses to fill in this IRP. </P>

<P>Because the <B>TdiBuildQueryInformation</B> macro sets the <B>RequestConnectionInformation</B> member of the TDI_REQUEST_KERNEL_QUERY_INFORMATION structure to NULL, a client of a NetBIOS transport cannot use <B>TdiBuildQueryInformation</B> with query type TDI_QUERY_FIND_NAME. To set up an IRP for a TDI_QUERY_INFORMATION request using TDI_QUERY_FIND_NAME, a client of a NetBIOS transport can use code similar to the code for <B>TdiBuildQueryInformation</B> but must specify a pointer to a TDI_CONNECTION_INFORMATION structure for <B>RequestConnectionInformation</B>. </P>
