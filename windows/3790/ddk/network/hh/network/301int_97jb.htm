<P>When a NIC becomes available, NDIS calls the <A HREF="104tdlow_2bqq.htm"><I>ProtocolBindAdapter</I></A> function of any intermediate driver that can bind to that NIC. </P>

<P>An intermediate driver must provide the protocol binding operations documented in <A HREF="302pro_1isn.htm">Protocol Driver Binding Operations</A>.  </P>

<P>Binding-time actions include allocating and initializing a NIC-specific context area for the binding, initializing any virtual miniports, and calling <A HREF="103ndisx_9koi.htm"><B>NdisOpenAdapter</B></A> to bind to the adapter. </P>

<P>Intermediate drivers should always allocate packet pools to copy packets. In addition, such drivers should:

<UL>
	<LI>Allocate a packet pool for each binding. </LI>

	<LI>Allocate different pools for send and receive. </LI>
</UL>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Intermediate drivers should allocate packet pools even though the driver does not modify the packets or the driver uses packet stacks. Packet stacking does not guarantee that there is always a stack location available. </P>

<P>For information about the requirement to allocate and manage packets, see <A HREF="301int_955z.htm">Intermediate Driver Packet Management</A>. </P>
