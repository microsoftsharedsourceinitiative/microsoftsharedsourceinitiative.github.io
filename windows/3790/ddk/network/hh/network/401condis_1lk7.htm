<P>A connection-oriented client calls <A HREF="103ndisx_108i.htm"><B>NdisClCloseAddressFamily</B></A> to delete the association between itself, a call manager, and a particular underlying NIC.</P>

<P>The following figure shows a client of a call manager closing an address family.</P>

<P><B>Closing an Address Family Through an MCM Driver</B></P>

<P>A client commonly calls <B>NdisClCloseAddressFamily</B> from its <A HREF="104tdlow_1l6a.htm"><I>ProtocolUnbindAdapter</I></A> function after it closes all its open VCs on the binding (see <A HREF="401condis_3i07.htm">Client-Initiated Request to Close a Call</A>) and deregisters any SAPs (see <A HREF="401condis_4jfr.htm">Deregistering a SAP</A>). NDIS calls a client's <I>ProtocolUnbindAdapter</I> function whenever an underlying NIC to which that client is bound is removed from the machine or is reconfigured. A client can also call <B>NdisClCloseAddressFamily</B> in the context of processing an <A HREF="211cooid_5vn6.htm">OID_CO_AF_CLOSE</A> request.</P>

<P>The call to <B>NdisClCloseAddressFamily</B> causes NDIS to call the <A HREF="104tdlow_3z76.htm"><I>ProtocolCmCloseAf</I></A> function of the call manager or MCM driver that the client originally used to open the address family. <I>ProtocolCmCloseAf</I> releases and/or deactivates any resources that were allocated by the call manager in its <I>ProtocolCmOpenAf</I> function. The call manager also should undo any other actions it took on behalf of the connection-oriented client when the address family was opened by that client.</P>

<P><I>ProtocolCmCloseAf</I> can complete synchronously or asynchronously. To complete asynchronously, the <I>ProtocolCmCloseAf </I>function of a call manager calls <A HREF="103ndisx_2h9u.htm"><B>NdisCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</B></A>. The <I>ProtocolCmCloseAf</I> function of an MCM driver calls <A HREF="103ndisx_7gfm.htm"><B>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</B></A>.</P>

<P>If any outstanding requests or connections remain open on an address family, a call manager can respond to a client's request to close the address family in either of the following ways:

<UL>
	<LI>The call manager or MCM driver can fail the request with NDIS_STATUS_NOT_ACCEPTED.</LI>

	<LI>The call manager or MCM driver can return NDIS_STATUS_PENDING. After the client has closed all calls and deregistered all SAPs, the call manager or MCM driver can then close the address family and call <B>Ndis(M)CmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</B> to notify the client. This is the preferred response.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The call to <B>Ndis(M)CmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</B> causes NDIS to call the <A HREF="104tdlow_89gy.htm"><I>ProtocolClCloseAfComplete</I></A> function of the connection-oriented client that originally called <B>NdisClCloseAddressFamily</B>.</P>
