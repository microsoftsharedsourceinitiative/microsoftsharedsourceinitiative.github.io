<P>Infrared SIR devices that attach internally and that do not support any Plug and Play functionality are not exposed as Plug and Play SIR devices through the system BIOS. These devices are detected and installed or they are manually installed as conventional serial ports. </P>

<P>If the IrDA UART of an infrared SIR device is exposed through the BIOS only as a conventional serial device, the device is installed as such. In this case, the user experience is the same as in the case described in <A HREF="210irda_6vzb.htm">Non-Plug and Play External Serial-Attached SIR Adapters</A>.</P>

<P>This configuration is not recommended.</P>
