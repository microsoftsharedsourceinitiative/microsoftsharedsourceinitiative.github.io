<P>This function is <B>obsolete</B> for Windows XP (SP1 and later), Windows Server 2003, and later operating systems.</P>

<P>A network migration DLL must supply a <B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B> function. <B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B> supplies the DLL with information about the upgrade environment. The <B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B> function also supplies NetSetup with vendor information and can cause NetSetup to display a message that prompts the user to abort the upgrade of the operating system.</P>

<H4>Return Value</H4>

<P>The <B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B> function can return either:

<DL>
<DT>ERROR_SUCCESS</DT>

<DD>Migration DLL found one or more installed components. </DD>

<DT>ERROR_<I>XXX</I></DT>

<DD>A Win32 error code that causes NetSetup to display an error message, clean up the network migration DLL files, and prompt the user to quit the upgrade of the operating system.
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Headers</H4>

<P>Declared in <I>OemUpGex.h</I>. Include <I>OemUpGex.h</I>. </P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>NetSetup calls a network migration DLL's <B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B> function once during the Winnt32 phase of the operating system upgrade. NetSetup calls <B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B> before calling the DLL's <B>DoPreUpgradeProcessing</B> function.</P>

<P><B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B> supplies the network migration DLL with information about the source operating system and the target operating system. Specifically, the <B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B> function specifies the product type (Microsoft Windows NT Workstation or Microsoft Windows NT Server) and build number of:

<UL>
	<LI>The operating system being upgraded</LI>

	<LI>The operating system being installed</LI>
</UL>

<P>The <B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B> function passes a pointer (<I>pviVendorInfo</I>) to NetSetup that points to vendor information formatted as a VENDORINFO structure. NetSetup displays this information if <B>PreUpgradeInitialize </B>returns a Win32 error code.</P>

<P>If an error occurs, <B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B> returns a Win32 error code. NetSetup reports the error to the user, cleans up the upgrade DLL files, and asks the user to quit or continue the installation of the operating system.</P>
