<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>The SAN service provider exclusively controls only the <B>Offset</B> and <B>OffsetHigh</B> members of the WSAOVERLAPPED structure even though the SAN service provider's <B>WSPGetOverlappedResult</B> function must retrieve three values (byte count, flags, and error) from the structure. A SAN service provider can retrieve these three values any way it chooses as long as it interacts properly with the behavior of the <B>WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest</B> function. The following sequence outlines a typical implementation of <B>WSPGetOverlappedResult</B>:

<OL>
	<LI>At the start of an I/O operation, the SAN service provider sets the <B>Internal</B> member of the WSAOVERLAPPED structure to WSS_OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS. </LI>

	<LI>After the I/O operation is complete, the SAN service provider performs the following actions: 
<UL>
	<LI>Sets <B>OffsetHigh</B> to the Windows Sockets error code resulting from the I/O operation. </LI>

	<LI>Sets <B>Offset</B> to the flags resulting from the I/O operation. </LI>

	<LI>Calls <B>WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest</B> and passes the number of bytes transferred. </LI>
</UL>
</LI>

	<LI><B>WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest</B> eventually sets the <B>InternalHigh</B> member of the WSAOVERLAPPED structure to the number of bytes transferred and then sets <B>Internal</B> to a value other than WSS_OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS.</LI>

	<LI>After the switch calls the SAN service provider's <B>WSPGetOverlappedResult</B> function, the SAN service provider checks the value in <B>Internal</B>. If the value is WSS_OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS, the SAN service provider waits for the event object (<B>hEvent</B> member) to be set to the signaled state or returns an error, based on the value that the switch passed to the <I>fWait</I> parameter of <B>WSPGetOverlappedResult</B>. If the value is not WSS_OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS, or after the operating system signals the event object, the SAN service provider returns the number of bytes transferred, the operation result error code, and the flags in the <B>InternalHigh</B>, <B>OffsetHigh</B>, and <B>Offset</B> members, respectively.</LI>
</OL>
