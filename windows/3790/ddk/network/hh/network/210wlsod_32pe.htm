<P>This OID notifies an underlying miniport driver to either enable or disable the PIN security feature of the Subscriber Information Module (SIM). This OID is defined as OPTIONAL.</P>

<P>This request uses a WW_ENABLE_SIM_PIN structure, defined as follows:</P>

<PRE class=syntax>typedef struct _WW_ENABLE_SIM_PIN {
  <B>IN  </B>BOOLEAN  bEnabled; 
  <B>IN  </B>NDIS_VAR_DATA_DESC  CurrentPIN; 
} WW_ENABLE_SIM_PIN;
</PRE>

<P>The members of this structure contain the following information:

<DL>
<DT><B>bEnabled</B></DT>

<DD>Boolean value that is TRUE if the PIN security feature for the SIM is enabled and FALSE if the PIN for the SIM is disabled. A value of TRUE requires protocols and applications to enter the correct PIN for the SIM before access to the NIC’s services is granted.</DD>

<DT><B>CurrentPIN</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies a <A HREF="210wlsod_7sky.htm">NDIS_VAR_DATA_DESC</A> type that describes a buffer containing the PIN that was previously programmed into the SIM. For security reasons, the miniport driver should erase any internal copies of the PIN after using the PIN or after determining that a PIN is not required to access the NIC’s services. </DD>
</DL>

<P>The PIN security feature of a SIM is used to lock the phone into which it is inserted until the PIN is entered on the keypad for the phone. This OID was introduced as a solution for devices that do not have keypads such as computer cards. Until this OID was introduced, there was no programmatic mechanism provided to unlock a SIM.</P>

<P>If a miniport driver's NIC does not use a SIM, the miniport driver should return an error value of NDIS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED for incoming requests to enable or disable a SIM.</P>

<P>Queries and indications are irrelevant for this OID.</P>
