<P>A group of tools for use in developing IrDA miniport drivers and testing IrDA adapters is provided as part of the Windows DDK. The tools are as follows:</P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="210irda_03tz.htm">DbgCon</A></P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="210irda_406f.htm">Sledge</A></P>

<P class=indent1><A HREF="210irda_4icn.htm">Sniffir</A></P>

<P>In addition to the preceding tools, the Microsoft® Windows® Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) provides test kits that contain the following tools useful in developing IrDA miniport drivers. These tools include test programs that operate at NDIS level and Windows® Sockets (WinSock) level. 

<DL>
<DT>IrDA Transport Test</DT>

<DD>Tests operations between IrDA miniport drivers and the IrDA protocol stack. This test calls Winsock functions to verify that the content that an IrDA miniport driver delivers is correct. In addition, this test checks for multiple-socket and multiple-threading capabilities, which further ensures that IrDA devices and related miniport drivers operate successfully with the operating system.</DD>

<DT>NDIS Test</DT>

<DD>Contains individual functional tests run through a separate test shell (NDISTEST). This test verifies that the data delivery methods that an IrDA miniport driver uses are correct. The functional tests verify that all requests to the IrDA miniport driver, along with all operations that are called from within the driver to indicate data up the stack and to complete other requests and operations, work correctly. </DD>

<DT>Modem Test</DT>

<DD>Certifies modem capabilities of IrDA-enabled mobile phones. This test is a functional test of NDIS test that is specific to modems.
