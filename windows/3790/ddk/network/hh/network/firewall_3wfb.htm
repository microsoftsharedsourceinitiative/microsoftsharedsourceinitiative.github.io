<P>It is not recommended to implement a <I>firewall-hook driver</I> (or <I>firewall driver</I>) for Microsoft® Windows® XP and later versions of the operating system. </P>

<P>The Microsoft® Windows® 2000 DDK introduced the concept of a firewall-hook driver. The intent of a firewall-hook driver was to manage network packets that were sent and received across a firewall in the context of the TCP/IP protocol. A <I>firewall </I>is a control system that prevents unauthorized users from gaining access to a local network that is connected to the Internet. </P>

<P>A firewall-hook driver did not meet firewall requirements because it ran too high in the network stack. A firewall-hook driver could also interfere with the operations of Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) or a personal firewall implementation. </P>

<P>To provide firewall functionality on Windows XP and later, you should create an NDIS intermediate miniport driver to manage packets sent and received across a firewall. For information on creating an NDIS intermediate miniport driver, see <A HREF="301int_0x2f.htm">NDIS Intermediate Drivers</A>.</P>
