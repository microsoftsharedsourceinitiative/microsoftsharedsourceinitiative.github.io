<OL>
	<LI>Create a directory on the system for each network component to be upgraded. </LI>

	<LI>Copy the vendor-supplied upgrade files for each network component to the appropriate directory that you created in Step 1. These files must include a netmap.inf file. NetSetup uses the netmap.inf file to identify which network components to upgrade. </LI>

	<LI>Create a netupg.inf file that contains an <B>OemNetUpgradeDirs</B> section and place it a directory of your choice. Each line in the <B>OemNetUpgradeDirs</B> section of the netupg.inf file specifies a path to a directory created in Step 1. Each directory specified in the netupg.inf file must contain the vendor-supplied upgrade files for the network component, including a netmap.inf file. </LI>

	<LI>Set the NET_UPGRD_INIT_FILE_DIR environment variable to the directory that contains the netupg.inf file.</LI>
</OL>

<P>During the Winnt32 phase of the network upgrade, NetSetup locates the <I>netupg.inf</I> file in the directory specified by the NETUPGRD_INIT_FILE_DIR environment variable. In each directory specified in the <I>netupg.inf</I> file, NetSetup then locates the <I>netmap.inf</I> file and other vendor files for the network component to be upgraded. NetSetup processes these files to upgrade the component. For more information, see <A HREF="503upgrade_2von.htm">The Network Upgrade Process</A>.</P>
