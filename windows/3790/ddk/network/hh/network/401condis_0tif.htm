<P>A call manager is an NDIS protocol; therefore, it follows the initialization sequence for a connection-oriented protocol, but with one additional step. in its <A HREF="104tdlow_2bqq.htm"><I>ProtocolBindAdapter</I></A> handler, immediately after completing the initialization steps for a connection-oriented protocol, a call manager must register an address family by calling <A HREF="103ndisx_58tu.htm"><B>NdisCmRegisterAddressFamily</B></A>. The call to <B>NdisCmRegisterAddressFamily</B>, in which a call manager registers its call manager functions, identifies the protocol as a call manager. The call manager must register an address family for each NIC to which it binds itself.</P>

<P>An MCM driver is a miniport driver; therefore, it follows the initialization sequence for a connection-oriented miniport driver with the addition of the following step: an MCM driver must register an address family by calling <A HREF="103ndisx_58fm.htm"><B>NdisMCmRegisterAddressFamily</B></A> in its <A HREF="101mini_9jzm.htm"><I>MiniportInitialize</I></A> function, immediately after completing the miniport driver initialization sequence . The call to <B>NdisMCmRegisterAddressFamily</B>, in which an MCM driver registers its call manager functions, distinguishes the MCM driver from a regular connection-oriented miniport driver. Although an MCM driver registers its miniport driver handlers only once during initialization by calling <A HREF="103ndisx_6tte.htm"><B>NdisMRegisterMiniport</B></A>, it must call <A HREF="103ndisx_58fm.htm"><B>NdisMCmRegisterAddressFamily</B></A> once for each NIC that it controls.</P>
