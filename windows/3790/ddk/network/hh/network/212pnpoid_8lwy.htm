<P>The OID_PNP_ADD_WAKE_UP_PATTERN OID is sent by a protocol driver to a miniport driver to specify a wake-up pattern. The wake-up pattern, along with its mask, is described by an NDIS_PM_PACKET_PATTERN structure. For more information on this structure, see <A HREF="105nstru_8sfm.htm">NDIS_PM_PACKET_PATTERN</A>.</P>

<P>A protocol that enables pattern-match wake-up for a miniport driver (see <A HREF="212pnpoid_58fm.htm">OID_PNP_ENABLE_WAKE_UP</A>) uses <A HREF="#ddk_oid_pnp_add_wake_up_pattern_nr">OID_PNP_ADD_WAKE_UP_PATTERN</A> to specify a wake-up pattern. The wake-up pattern can be stored in host memory or on the NIC, depending on the capabilities of the NIC.</P>

<P>The <I>InformationBuffer</I> contains the following:

<UL>
	<LI>An NDIS_PM_PACKET_PATTERN structure that provides information about the pattern and its mask.</LI>

	<LI>A mask that indicates which bytes of an incoming packet should be compared with corresponding bytes in the pattern. The mask starts with the first byte of the packet, excluding token ring source routing information in a token ring packet. The mask immediately follows the NDIS_PM_PACKET_PATTERN structure in the <I>InformationBuffer</I>. For more information on how this mask works, see the <I>Network Device Class Power Management Reference</I> specification, which can be downloaded from http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/tech/onnow/default.asp.</LI>

	<LI>A wake-up pattern, which begins <I>PatternOffset</I> bytes from the beginning of the <I>InformationBuffer</I>. For more information on wake-up patterns, see the <I>Network Device Class Power Management Reference</I> specification, which can be downloaded from http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/tech/onnow/default.asp.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The number of wake-up patterns that the miniport driver can accept from a protocol might depend on the availability of resources, such as the host memory that the miniport driver has allocated for such patterns, or the available storage in the NIC. If a miniport driver cannot add a wake-up pattern due to insufficient resources, the miniport driver returns NDIS_STATUS_RESOURCES in response to OID_PNP_ADD_WAKE_UP_PATTERN.</P>

<P>An intermediate driver whose upper edge receives this OID request must always propagate the request to the underlying miniport driver by calling <A HREF="103ndisx_0u42.htm"><B>NdisRequest</B></A>. or <A HREF="103ndisx_8xde.htm"><B>NdisCoRequest</B></A>.</P>
