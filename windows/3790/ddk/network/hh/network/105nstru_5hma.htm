<P>The WAN_CO_LINKPARAMS structure describes status associated with the virtual connection (VC) on a WAN NIC. This VC status is indicated up to higher-layer drivers by a CoNDIS WAN miniport. </P>

<DT><B>TransmitSpeed</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the speed at which the WAN miniport driver can transmit data over the network on this VC. This speed is in units of bytes per second. 

<P>NDISWAN defaults a <B>TransmitSpeed</B> of zero to 28.8 kilobits per second (Kbps). 
</DD>

<DT><B>ReceiveSpeed</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the speed at which the WAN miniport driver can receive data from the network on this VC. This speed is in units of bytes per second. 

<P>NDISWAN defaults a <B>ReceiveSpeed</B> of zero to 28.8 Kbps. 
</DD>

<DT><B>SendWindow</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of send packets the WAN miniport driver (or its NIC) can accept at a time, effectively how many NDIS_PACKET-type send packets the WAN miniport driver queues internally. Zero indicates that the WAN miniport driver cannot queue any send packets; that is, the "send window" between NDISWAN and the miniport driver is closed. If <B>SendWindow</B> is set to zero, the WAN miniport driver indicates that it cannot accept packets for the particular VC; therefore, NDISWAN must stop sending packets for that VC.

<P>A CoNDIS WAN NIC driver calls <A HREF="103ndisx_0qgi.htm"><B>NdisMCoIndicateStatus</B></A> with this type of indication after a VC between two communicating endpoints, such as two connection-oriented clients, in a wide area network becomes active. After such a VC is activated, the NIC driver makes this indication with the handle to the VC if connection characteristics change. For example, a NIC driver can make this indication if the originally specified <B>TransmitSpeed</B> of the connection changes. The NIC driver might also make this indication to dynamically change the value of <B>SendWindow</B>, which specifies the number of outstanding sends the NIC driver accepts for its internal queue. </P>

<P>After NDISWAN has submitted the number of packets specified in <B>SendWindow</B> to <A HREF="101mini_0ycy.htm"><I>MiniportCoSendPackets</I></A>, NDISWAN holds incoming send packets queued until the miniport driver returns a completed send packet or calls <A HREF="103ndisx_5t2q.htm"><B>NdisMCoSendComplete</B></A> with a packet for which it previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, whichever occurs first. Subsequent WAN_CO_LINKPARAMS structures can be indicated with calls to <B>NdisMCoIndicateStatus</B> if the NIC driver needs to change the <B>SendWindow</B> value dynamically. </P>

<P>Whenever WAN_CO_LINKPARAMS indications are made, whether to change the <B>SendWindow</B> value or for changes in VC characteristics, the <I>NdisVcHandle</I> parameter that is passed to <B>NdisMCoIndicateStatus</B> must be filled with the value that was set in the driver’s <I>MiniportCoCreateVc</I> function. The miniport driver must also supply this handle when it makes any subsequent <A HREF="105nstru_7zoy.htm">NDIS_WAN_CO_FRAGMENT</A> indications for the same VC.</P>
