<P>The implementation of status indications in intermediate drivers is nearly identical to the implementation in protocol drivers. For more information about intermediate driver status indications, see <A HREF="302pro_8m7b.htm">Status Indications in a Protocol Driver</A>. </P>

<P>Intermediate driver status indications differ from protocols as follows:

<UL>
	<LI>NDIS_STATUS_RESET_START and NDIS_STATUS_RESET_END are reported to both <I>Protocol(Co)Status</I> and <I>ProtocolStatusComplete</I> as explained in <A HREF="301int_8xk7.htm">Intermediate Driver Reset Operations</A>.</LI>

	<LI>When an intermediate driver receives a status indication, it indicates it up to the higher-level drivers by calling <B>NdisMIndicateStatus</B> <I>only</I> if the status indication causes the intermediate driver to change its internal state in a way that affects the operation of its <I>MiniportXxx</I> functions. That is, if the status indicated to the intermediate driver causes the driver to fail sends or requests, it can pass the status indication to the higher-level drivers which presumably will then hold off on submitting sends and requests. If, however, the intermediate driver continues to accept sends and requests, perhaps queuing them internally, it should not pass the status indication up. </LI>
