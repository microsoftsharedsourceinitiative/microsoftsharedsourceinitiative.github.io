<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>If a miniport driver has determined that a particular miniport driver adapter has failed and is unrecoverable, the miniport driver can call <B>NdisMRemoveMiniport</B> to remove the adapter from the system. In this call, the miniport driver passes the handle to the adapter to remove. </P>

<P>A miniport driver can use a bundle of miniport driver adapters to balance the work load that each miniport driver adapter carries and to enable a secondary miniport driver adapter to take over packet transfers and information requests if the primary miniport driver adapter fails. This capability is called load balancing and fail over (LBFO). For example, if the miniport driver's primary adapter fails, the miniport driver can call <B>NdisMRemoveMiniport</B> to remove the primary adapter from the system and from the miniport driver's bundle. The miniport driver can then call the <A HREF="103ndisx_1i0i.htm"><B>NdisMPromoteMiniport</B></A> function to promote a secondary adapter to the primary role. </P>

<P>The first miniport driver adapter that the miniport driver initialized is initially the primary miniport driver adapter. The primary miniport driver adapter handles all packet transfers and requests for information. A miniport driver can call the <A HREF="103ndisx_467m.htm"><B>NdisMSetMiniportSecondary</B></A> function during the subsequent initialization of several miniport driver adapters to set them all to secondary roles. That is, multiple secondary miniport driver adapters can exist in a bundle. </P>

<P>For information on adding LBFO capability to a miniport driver, see the readme for the passthru driver. This miniport driver is a sample intermediate miniport driver in the Windows DDK. </P>

<P>Callers of <B>NdisMRemoveMiniport</B> run at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. </P>
