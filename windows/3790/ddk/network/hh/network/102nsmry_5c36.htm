<P>NDIS miniport drivers of WAN NICs call the same NDIS library functions that other NIC miniport drivers call with very few exceptions. For a list of the common functions that WAN and LAN miniports call, see the preceding summary of <A HREF="102nsmry_01rm.htm">NDIS Library Functions Used by Miniport Drivers</A>. </P>

<P>However, WAN miniport drivers cannot call the following <B>Ndis</B><I>Xxx</I> functions:<BR>
<B>NdisMIndicateReceive</B><BR>
<B>NdisMIndicateReceiveComplete</B><BR>
<B>NdisMSendComplete</B></P>

<P>Instead, WAN miniport drivers call these functions:

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="103ndisx_9jaq.htm"><B>NdisMWanIndicateReceive</B></A> </DT>

<DD>Notifies NDIS that a packet has been received on a particular link, identified by the given link-context handle, and on a particular NIC, identified by the adapter handle, and that the full packet is available to be forwarded to the appropriate bound protocol driver(s). </DD>

<DT><A HREF="103ndisx_60aa.htm"><B>NdisMWanIndicateReceiveComplete</B></A> </DT>

<DD>Notifies NDIS that one or more receives on a particular link, identified by the given link-context handle, and on a particular NIC, identified by the adapter handle, are complete (that is, the preceding call to <B>NdisMWanIndicateReceive</B> has returned) so that NDIS can notify the appropriate bound protocol driver(s).</DD>

<DT><A HREF="103ndisx_7x0y.htm"><B>NdisMWanSendComplete</B></A> </DT>

<DD>Returns the packet and final status of a completed send request for which the driver previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING so that NDIS can return the completed packet to the appropriate bound protocol driver. 
</DD>
