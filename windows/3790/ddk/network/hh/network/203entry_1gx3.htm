<P>A miniport driver for connectionless media handles send packets with its <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> function. NDIS also supports a <I>MiniportSend</I> function for legacy connectionless miniports.</P>

<P><I>MiniportSendPackets</I> can input more than one packet in a single call. NDIS passes packets to <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> as an array of pointers to packet descriptors. <I>MiniportSend</I>, however, can input only one packet in a single call.</P>

<P>In general, a miniport driver supplies a <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> function if it can simultaneously send multiple packets to its NIC. For example, a miniport driver that manages a bus-master DMA NIC that has an onboard ring typically supplies a <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> function. For such a NIC, the miniport driver can set up the ring with a number of packets and transmit them in a single operation.</P>

<P>Even if a NIC can only accept one packet at a time for transmission, improved performance can be attained by queuing within the miniport driver packets received by <I>MiniportSendPackets</I>. Such a strategy avoids the latency of repeated calls to <I>MiniportSend</I>.</P>

<P>If a miniport driver supplies entry points for both <I>MiniportSend</I> and <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> in NDIS_MINIPORT_CHARACTERISTICS, NDIS always calls <I>MiniportSendPackets</I> to pass send requests to the miniport driver.</P>
