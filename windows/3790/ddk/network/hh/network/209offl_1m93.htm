<P>When a NIC performs Internet Protocol security (IPSec) processing on a receive packet, it decrypts the packet if the packet contains an ESP payload and calculates the AH and/or ESP encryption checksum(s) for the packet. Before indicating the packet up to the TCP/IP transport, the miniport driver calls the <A HREF="103ndisx_0bjm.htm">NDIS_PER_PACKET_INFO_FROM_PACKET</A> macro with an <I>InfoType</I> of <B>IpSecNdisTask</B> to obtain a pointer to the <A HREF="105nstru_2tbm.htm">NDIS_IPSEC_PACKET_INFO</A> structure that is associated with a packet. Alternatively, it can call the <A HREF="103ndisx_6pyq.htm">NDIS_PACKET_EXTENSION_FROM_PACKET</A> macro to obtain a pointer to the <A HREF="105nstru_9oqa.htm">NDIS_PACKET_EXTENSION</A> structure that is associated with the packet descriptor. </P>

<P>The miniport driver sets the CRYPTO_DONE flag in the NDIS_IPSEC_PACKET_INFO structure to indicate that its NIC performed IPSec checking on at least one IPSec payload in the receive packet. If the miniport driver's NIC performed IPSec checking on both the tunnel and transport portions of a receive packet, the miniport driver also sets the NEXT_CRYPTO_DONE flag in the NDIS_IPSEC_PACKET_INFO structure. The miniport driver sets NEXT_CRYPTO_DONE only if a packet has both tunnel and transport IPSec payloads. Otherwise, the miniport driver sets NEXT_CRYPTO_DONE to zero. To indicate the results of the IPSec checks, the miniport driver must also supply a value for the <B>CryptoStatus</B> member in the NDIS_IPSEC_PACKET_INFO structure. If the NIC detects a checksum failure or a decryption failure, the miniport driver must indicate up the receive packet in whatever form it is and specify the appropriate <B>CryptoStatus</B> value.</P>

<P>Note that, if the miniport driver is not decrypting an incoming packet, it clears both the CRYPTO_DONE and the NEXT_CRYPTO_DONE flags. The miniport driver does this for all receive packets that it does not decrypt, regardless of whether the packet is AH-protected or ESP-protected. The miniport driver sets <B>CryptoStatus</B> to CRYPTO_SUCCESS for all packets that it does not decrypt.</P>

<P>After the miniport driver indicates the packet to the TCP/IP transport, the transport examines the results of the IPSec checks that the NIC performed, checks the sequence number(s) for the packet, and determines what to do with a packet that fails the checksum and/or sequencing tests.</P>
