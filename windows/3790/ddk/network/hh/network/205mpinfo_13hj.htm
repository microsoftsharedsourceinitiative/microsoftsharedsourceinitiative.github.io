<P>Each miniport driver contains its own MIB, which is an information block in which the driver stores dynamic configuration information and statistical information that a management entity can query or set. An Ethernet multicast address list is an example of configuration information. The number of broadcast packets received is an example of statistical information. Each information element within the MIB is referred to as an <I>object</I>. To refer to each such managed object, NDIS defines an <I>Object Identifier</I>. Therefore, if a management entity wants to query or set a particular managed object, it must provide the specific OID for that object.</P>

<P>The MIB tracks three classes of objects: 

<UL>
	<LI>Those general to all NDIS miniport drivers</LI>

	<LI>Those specific to all NDIS miniport drivers for a given medium type, such as Ethernet or Token Ring</LI>

	<LI>Those specific to a particular vendor implementation</LI>
</UL>

<P>The <I>general</I> and mandatory <I>media-specific</I> OIDs are documented in the <I>Network Driver Reference</I>. The implementation-specific OIDs for a particular NIC driver should be listed and described in the documentation accompanying a given NIC driver. </P>

<P>Besides being classified as either <I>operational characteristics</I> (for example, multicast address list) or <I>statistics</I> (for example, broadcast packets received), objects are classified as either <I>mandatory</I> or <I>optional</I>. All operational characteristics objects for either general or media-specific classes are mandatory, but only some statistics objects are mandatory. All implementation-specific objects are classified as mandatory.</P>

<P>The following figure shows the structure of an OID. </P>

<P><B>NDIS OID Format</B></P>

<P>The first 3 bytes of the OID provide a key to the OID’s various classifications. The fourth byte identifies the specific information management object within those classifications.</P>
