<P>If a client is closing a multipoint call to which more than one party is still connected, it must first call <A HREF="103ndisx_2tf6.htm"><B>NdisClDropParty</B></A> as many times as necessary to drop all but the last party from the call (see <A HREF="401condis_8wo7.htm">Dropping a Party from a Multipoint Call</A>).</P>

<P>A client initiates the closing of a call with <A HREF="103ndisx_7rsi.htm"><B>NdisClCloseCall</B></A>. The following figure shows a client initiating the closing of a call through a call manager.</P>

<P><B>Client Initiates a Request to Close a Call Through an MCM Driver</B></P>

<P>A connection-oriented client usually calls <B>NdisClCloseCall</B> in any one of the following circumstances: 

<UL>
	<LI>To close an established outgoing or incoming call.</LI>

	<LI>From the <A HREF="104tdlow_3nqq.htm"><I>ProtocolClIncomingCloseCall</I></A> function to tear down an established call (see <A HREF="401condis_0xk7.htm">Incoming Request to Close a Call</A>).</LI>

	<LI>From the <A HREF="104tdlow_6vzm.htm"><I>ProtocolClIncomingCallQoSChange</I></A> function to tear down an established call if a QoS change proposed by the remote party is unacceptable (see <A HREF="401condis_16qv.htm">Incoming Request to Change Call Parameters</A>).</LI>

	<LI>From the <A HREF="104tdlow_3boy.htm"><I>ProtocolClModifyCallQoSComplete</I></A> function to tear down an established call if a QoS change proposed by the client is unacceptable to the remote party (see <A HREF="401condis_1j6v.htm">Client-Initiated Request to Change Call Parameters</A>).</LI>
</UL>

<P>A client's call to <B>NdisClCloseCall</B> causes NDIS to call the call manager's or MCM driver's <A HREF="104tdlow_8j1u.htm"><I>ProtocolCmCloseCall</I></A> function. <I>ProtocolCmCloseCall</I> must communicate with network control devices to terminate a connection between the local node and a remote node.</P>

<P>If <I>ProtocolCmCloseCall</I> is passed an explicit <I>CallMgrPartyContext</I>, then the call being terminated is a multipoint call. The call manager or MCM driver must perform any necessary network communication with its networking hardware, as appropriate to its media type, to terminate the call as a multipoint call.</P>

<P>NDIS can pass <I>ProtocolCmCloseCall</I> a pointer to a buffer containing data supplied by the client in the call to <B>NdisClClose</B>. This data can be diagnostic data indicating why the call was closed or any other data required by the signaling protocol. <I>ProtocolCmCloseCall</I> must send any such data across the network before completing the call termination. If sending data concurrent with a connection being terminated is not supported, a call manager or MCM driver should return NDIS_STATUS_INVALID_DATA.</P>

<P><I>ProtocolCmCloseCall</I> can complete synchronously or, more probably, asynchronously with <A HREF="103ndisx_18tu.htm"><B>NdisCmCloseCallComplete</B></A> (in the case of a call manager) or <A HREF="103ndisx_4fzm.htm"><B>NdisMCmCloseCallComplete</B></A> (in the case of an MCM driver). A call to <B>Ndis(M)CmCloseCallComplete</B> causes NDIS to call the client's <A HREF="104tdlow_3ofm.htm"><I>ProtocolClCloseCallComplete</I></A> function.</P>

<P>The call manager or MCM driver must then initiate deactivation of the VC used for the call by respectively calling <A HREF="103ndisx_5g4y.htm"><B>NdisCmDeactivateVc</B></A> or <A HREF="103ndisx_1nqq.htm"><B>NdisMCmDeactivateVc</B></A> (see <A HREF="401condis_3dyf.htm">Deactivating a VC</A>). The creator of the VC (client, call manager, or MCM driver) can then optionally initiate deletion of the VC (see <A HREF="401condis_3d2f.htm">Deleting a VC</A>).</P>
