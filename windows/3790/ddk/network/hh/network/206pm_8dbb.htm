<H1><A NAME="ddk_required_and_optional_oids_for_power_management_ng"></A>Required and Optional OIDs for Power Management</H1>

<P>For a miniport driver, supporting power management involves supporting power management object identifiers (OIDs). For a detailed description of how miniport drivers process queries and sets to OIDs, see <A HREF="205mpinfo_96nb.htm">Obtaining and Setting Miniport Driver Information and NDIS Support for WMI</A>.</P>

<P>There are two levels of power management support for miniport drivers:

<OL>
	<LI>A miniport driver can support its NIC making a transition between power states. This is the minimum level of power management support. For a description of device power states for NICs, see <A HREF="206pm_82uf.htm">Device Power States for NICs</A>.</LI>

	<LI>A miniport driver can also support one or more <A HREF="206pm_3wbr.htm">network wake-up events</A>.</LI>
</OL>

<P>A miniport driver must support the following OIDs for its NIC to make a transition between power states:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="212pnpoid_5j02.htm">OID_PNP_CAPABILITIES</A> 
<P>If the miniport driver returns NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS in response to a query of this OID, NDIS treats a miniport driver as power management-aware. If the miniport driver returns NDIS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED, NDIS treats the miniport driver as a legacy miniport driver that is not power management-aware.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="212pnpoid_9pwy.htm">OID_PNP_QUERY_POWER</A> 
<P>This OID specifies a device power state to which the NIC should prepare to transition. A miniport driver must always return NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS in response to a query of OID_PNP_QUERY_POWER. By returning NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS in response to this OID request, the miniport driver guarantees that it will transition the NIC to the specified device power state on receipt of a subsequent OID_PNP_SET_POWER request. The miniport driver, in this case, must do nothing to jeopardize the transition.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="212pnpoid_52sy.htm">OID_PNP_SET_POWER</A> 
<P>This OID indicates that the NIC <I>will</I> transition to the indicated device power state. A miniport driver must prepare the NIC for the transition to the specified state before the driver returns NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS. A miniport driver must always return NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS in response to this OID.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>To support network wake-up events, a miniport driver must also support the <A HREF="212pnpoid_58fm.htm">OID_PNP_ENABLE_WAKE_UP</A> OID. Both protocol drivers and NDIS use this OID to enable a NIC's wake-up capabilities. For more information, see <A HREF="206pm_2qjr.htm">Enabling Wake-Up Events</A>.</P>

<P>To support network wake-up frames (see <A HREF="206pm_3wbr.htm">Network Wake-Up Events</A>), a miniport driver must also support the following OIDs that are related to wake-up events:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="212pnpoid_8lwy.htm">OID_PNP_ADD_WAKE_UP_PATTERN</A> 
<P>A protocol driver uses this OID to add a wake-up pattern to a list that either the NIC or miniport driver or both maintain.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="212pnpoid_9q7m.htm">OID_PNP_REMOVE_WAKE_UP_PATTERN</A> 
<P>A protocol driver uses this OID to delete a wake-up pattern that it previously specified with OID_PNP_ADD_WAKE_UP_PATTERN.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>NDIS miniport drivers that support network wake-up events can optionally support the following statistical OIDs that are related to wake-up events:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="212pnpoid_6v76.htm">OID_PNP_WAKE_UP_ERROR</A> 
<P>Protocol drivers query this OID to determine the number of false wake-ups signaled by the miniport driver's NIC.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="212pnpoid_85pu.htm">OID_PNP_WAKE_UP_OK</A> 
<P>Protocol drivers query this OID to determine the number of valid wake-ups that are signaled by the miniport driver's NIC.
</LI>
</UL>
