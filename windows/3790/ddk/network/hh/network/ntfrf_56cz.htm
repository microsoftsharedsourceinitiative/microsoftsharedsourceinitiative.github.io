<P>The OBO_TOKEN structure contains information that describes an entity requiring the installation of a network component. This entity can be the user, another network component, or a software component that is not a network component. If this entity is another network component or a software component, it requires the network component in order to operate properly. If the entity is the user, the network component is being installed simply as a convenience to the user.</P>

<DT><B>Type</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the type of entity that requires the installation of a network component. Also specifies whether a user can remove the network component. Type can be one of the values contained in the <A HREF="ntfrf_0x9u.htm">OBO_TOKEN_TYPE</A> enumeration. </DD>

<DT><B>pncc</B></DT>

<DD>Pointer to a <A HREF="ntfrf_0ar6.htm"><B>INetCfgComponent</B></A> interface representing the network configuration of the component that requires the installation of another network component. Set this member to a pointer to a <B>INetCfgComponent</B> interface only if the <B>Type</B> member will be set to OBO_COMPONENT. If the <B>Type</B> member is not OBO_COMPONENT, this member is a NULL value.</DD>

<DT><B>pszwManufacturer</B></DT>

<DD>Pointer to a constant null-terminated string of 16-bit Unicode characters containing the name of the manufacturer that identifies the entity requiring the installation of a network component. This entity is a software component but not a network component. Set this member to a pointer to a string only if the <B>Type</B> member will be set to OBO_SOFTWARE. If the <B>Type</B> member is not OBO_SOFTWARE, this member is a NULL value.</DD>

<DT><B>pszwProduct</B></DT>

<DD>Pointer to a constant null-terminated string of 16-bit Unicode characters containing the name of the product that identifies the entity requiring the installation of a network component. This entity is a software component but not a network component. Set this member to a pointer to a string only if the <B>Type</B> member will be set to OBO_SOFTWARE. If the <B>Type</B> member is not OBO_SOFTWARE, this member is a NULL value.</DD>

<DT><B>pszwDisplayName</B></DT>

<DD>Pointer to a constant null-terminated string of 16-bit Unicode characters containing the name displayed to users that identifies the entity requiring the installation of a network component. This entity is a software component but not a network component. Set this member to a pointer to a string only if the <B>Type</B> member will be set to OBO_SOFTWARE. If the <B>Type</B> member is not OBO_SOFTWARE, this member is a NULL value.</DD>

<DT><B>fRegistered</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies a Boolean value that is TRUE if a network component is set in the registry as installed, and FALSE otherwise. This network component is installed on behalf of the entity specified by the <B>Type</B> member. This member should initially be set to FALSE before the network component installs; the network configuration subsystem sets the component as installed in the registry.
