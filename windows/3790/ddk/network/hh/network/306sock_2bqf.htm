<P>An application written to communicate through Windows Sockets with a transport that supports connect data should call <B>setsockopt</B> with SOL_SOCKET as the level, SO_CONNDATA as the option name, and an option value that is a pointer to a buffer containing the connect data the transport should send to the remote node with the connection request. Such an application must call <B>setsockopt</B> before it calls <B>connect</B>, and the application-supplied connect data is transmitted when the application makes its call to <B>connect</B>.</P>

<P>Besides making a call to <B>connect</B>, retrieving response-connect data requires two additional steps:

<OL>
	<LI>Before calling <B>connect</B>, the application must inform Windows Sockets of how much space to reserve for the expected response-connect data. To do this, the application calls <B>setsockopt</B> with option level SOL_SOCKET, option name SO_CONNDATALEN, and option pointing to an integer that specifies the maximum number of bytes the application expects. Windows Sockets allocates a buffer of this size to contain connect data sent by the server application from the remote node.</LI>

	<LI>After <B>connect</B> has completed successfully, the application can call <B>getsockopt</B> with an option level of SOL_SOCKET, option name of SO_CONNDATA, and option pointing to a large enough buffer to hold the response-connect data. Then, Windows Sockets copies the response-connect data, if any, into the application’s buffer.</LI>
</OL>

<P>After an application has set up a response-connect buffer, Windows Sockets uses that buffer for the lifetime of the socket. That is, an application can retrieve response-connect data for a particular socket at any time after the socket is connected and before it is closed.</P>
