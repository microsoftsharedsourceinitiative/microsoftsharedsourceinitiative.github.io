<P>The OID_802_11_BSSID_LIST_SCAN OID requests the miniport driver to direct the 802.11 NIC to request a survey of BSSs. No data is associated with this OID. The NIC will use the following parameters, set as defined in the 802.11 specifications, in its request:

<UL>
	<LI>BSSType indicates that both the infrastructure BSS and independent BSS are used.</LI>

	<LI>BSSID indicates that the BSSID is broadcast.</LI>

	<LI>SSID indicates that the SSID is broadcast.</LI>

	<LI>ScanType indicates active, passive, or a combination of both passive and active scanning approaches.</LI>

	<LI>ChannelList indicates all permitted frequency channels.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The NIC use active or passive scanning methods or a combination of both passive and active scanning methods to perform a scan. It might also refresh the list of BSSIDs in its database. </P>

<P>The NIC should minimize the response time for this OID. Active scanning is preferred, when possible. </P>

<P>The NIC's database includes BSSIDs for all BSS's responding on frequency channels that are permitted in the region in which the NIC is operating.</P>

<P><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the NIC is associated with a particular BSSID and SSID that are not contained in the list of BSSIDs generated by this scan, the BSSID description of the currently associated BSSID and SSID should be appended to the list of BSSIDs in the NIC's database. </P>

<P><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This OID might be called very frequently (for example, every five seconds). Miniport drivers should minimize the performance impact of servicing this OID. A query of this OID should not cause the NIC to associate with a different access point.</P>
