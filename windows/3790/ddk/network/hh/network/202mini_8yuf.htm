<P>When a connectionless miniport driver calls <A HREF="103ndisx_5uuq.htm"><B>NdisMIndicateReceivePacket</B></A> or a connection-oriented miniport driver calls <B>NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket</B>, the miniport driver passes a pointer to an array of packet descriptors, each of which describes a packet. Each packet that is indicated up must be completed separately by the miniport driver.</P>

<P>Connection-oriented miniport drivers identify the virtual connection (VC) on which the packet(s) have been received. At the request of the connection-oriented call manager or integrated miniport call manager (MCM) that received the incoming call from the network, the miniport driver previously set up and activated the VC in its <A HREF="101mini_7otu.htm"><I>MiniportCoCreateVc</I></A> and <A HREF="101mini_7piq.htm"><I>MiniportCoActivateVc</I></A> functions, respectively. The miniport driver passes an NDIS-supplied handle that identifies the VC in its call to <A HREF="103ndisx_6f02.htm"><B>NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket</B></A>.</P>

<P>For a detailed description of indicating up receive data with <B>NdisM(Co)IndicateReceivePacket</B> , see <A HREF="204trnsf_7mqv.htm">Indicating Receive Packets with NdisM(Co)IndicateReceivePacket</A></P>
