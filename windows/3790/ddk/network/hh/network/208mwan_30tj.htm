<P>This section discusses how a CoNDIS WAN miniport driver indicates  that it supports TAPI services and how it sets up TAPI-specific communications with the NDISWAN and NDPROXY drivers. </P>

<P>After a CoNDIS WAN miniport driver has registered its miniport driver entry points for one or more NICs, the following operations cause the NDISWAN and NDPROXY drivers to become associated, in a TAPI-specific way, with those NICs. 

<UL>
	<LI>The CoNDIS WAN miniport driver calls the <A HREF="103ndisx_58fm.htm"><B>NdisMCmRegisterAddressFamily</B></A> function from within its <A HREF="101mini_9jzm.htm"><I>MiniportInitialize</I></A> function to register its call-manager entry points and the address family type CO_ADDRESS_FAMILY_TAPI_PROXY. By doing so, the miniport driver advertises that it provides TAPI services. </LI>

	<LI>NDIS calls NDPROXY's <A HREF="104tdlow_2goi.htm"><I>ProtocolCoAfRegisterNotify</I></A> function to notify NDPROXY of the newly registered address family. NDPROXY's <I>ProtocolCoAfRegisterNotify</I> examines the address-family data and determines that it can use the TAPI services provided by the call manager that is integrated into the CoNDIS WAN miniport driver. A TAPI-capable CoNDIS WAN miniport driver is an integrated miniport call manager (MCM) driver. </LI>

	<LI>NDPROXY calls the <A HREF="103ndisx_6quq.htm"><B>NdisClOpenAddressFamily</B></A> function to open the TAPI-proxy address family that is associated with the CoNDIS WAN miniport driver. <B>NdisClOpenAddressFamily</B> registers NDPROXY's connection-oriented entry points with NDIS. These entry points are used to communicate with a TAPI-capable CoNDIS WAN miniport driver. </LI>

	<LI>NDPROXY calls <A HREF="103ndisx_58tu.htm"><B>NdisCmRegisterAddressFamily</B></A> to register its call-manager entry points and the address family type CO_ADDRESS_FAMILY_TAPI. By doing so, NDPROXY advertises that it implements TAPI services. </LI>

	<LI>NDIS calls NDISWAN's <I>ProtocolCoAfRegisterNotify</I> function to notify NDISWAN of the newly registered address family. NDISWAN's <I>ProtocolCoAfRegisterNotify</I> examines the address-family data and determines that NDISWAN can use the TAPI services provided by NDPROXY. </LI>

	<LI>NDISWAN calls the <B>NdisClOpenAddressFamily</B> function to open the TAPI address family that is associated with NDPROXY. <B>NdisClOpenAddressFamily</B> registers NDISWAN's connection-oriented entry points with NDIS. These entry points are used to communicate with NDPROXY. </LI>

	<LI>NDISWAN calls the <A HREF="103ndisx_22nm.htm"><B>NdisClRegisterSap</B></A> function to inform NDPROXY that NDISWAN can accept incoming calls on a particular Service Access Point (SAP). In this call, NDISWAN passes a <A HREF="105nstru_6pki.htm">CO_SAP</A> structure that describes the SAP. NDISWAN sets the <B>SapType</B> member of CO_SAP to AF_TAPI_SAP_TYPE to specify that the SAP will be used for TAPI calls. NDISWAN sets the <B>Sap</B> member of CO_SAP to a string for a particular TAPI device class. A TAPI application provides this string when the application calls the TAPI <B>lineGetID</B> function. NDPROXY should notify NDISWAN about all incoming calls addressed to the SAP. </LI>
