<P>Some miniport drivers, such as a miniport drivers for Ethernet network interface cards (NICs), receive packets that have a fixed and known size frame. If the frame size is always the same, the miniport driver can allocate packets with one or more chained buffers and can use the same packets for receives.</P>

<P>If, however, a miniport driver controls a NIC that receives variable-length frames, the size of a packet needed to handle a receive can vary from one receive to the next.</P>

<P>If a miniport driver must handle variable-length receives, it must do the following:

<OL>
	<LI>Chain and unchain buffers from a packet by calling <B>Ndis(Un)ChainBufferAtBack</B> or <B>Ndis(Un)ChainBufferAtFront</B> to build a larger, or make a smaller, packet indication.</LI>

	<LI>Call <A HREF="103ndisx_2pki.htm"><B>NdisAdjustBufferLength</B></A> before indicating a packet to set the size in the buffer descriptor for the last buffer in a chain if the full buffer is not used. Call <B>NdisAdjustBufferLength</B> when the packet is returned to reset the length to the actual full length of the buffer.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Buffers that are unchained from a packet descriptor should be kept in a free list to ensure they do not get “lost” and that they will be available when needed.</P>
