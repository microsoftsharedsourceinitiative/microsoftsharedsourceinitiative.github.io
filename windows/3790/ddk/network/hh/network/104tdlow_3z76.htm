<P>The <I>ProtocolCmCloseAf</I> function is a required function that releases per-open resources for an address family that a call manager supports.</P>

<PRE class=syntax><B>NDIS_STATUS
</B>  <B>ProtocolCmCloseAf(
</B>    <B>IN NDIS_HANDLE</B>  <I>CallMgrAfContext
</I>    <B>);</B></PRE>

<H4>Parameters</H4>

<DL>
<DT><I>CallMgrAfContext</I></DT>

<DD>Specifies the handle to the call manager's per-AF context area, originally supplied to NDIS by the call manager's <I>ProtocolCmOpenAf</I> function.
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Return Value</H4>

<P><I>ProtocolCmCloseAf</I> returns the status of its operation(s) as one of the following:

<DL>
<DT>NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS</DT>

<DD>Indicates that the call manager has successfully released or deactivated any resources that is allocated on behalf of the connection-oriented client that opened this instance of the address family.</DD>

<DT>NDIS_STATUS_PENDING</DT>

<DD>Indicates that the request to close the open instance of the address family will be completed asynchronously. The call manager must call <A HREF="103ndisx_2h9u.htm"><B>NdisCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</B></A> when all such operations have been completed.
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Headers</H4>

<P>Declared in <I>Ndis.h</I>. Include <I>Ndis.h</I>.</P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P><I>ProtocolCmCloseAf</I> releases and/or deactivates any resources that were allocated by the call manager in its <A HREF="104tdlow_5ape.htm"><I>ProtocolCmOpenAf</I></A> function. The call manager also should undo any other actions it took on behalf of the connection-oriented client when the address family was opened by that client.</P>

<P>If there are any outstanding requests or connections still open on an address family stored in the <I>CallMgrAfContext</I>, a call manager can respond to a client's request to close the address family in either of the following ways:

<UL>
	<LI>The call manager can fail the request with NDIS_STATUS_NOT_ACCEPTED.</LI>

	<LI>The call manager can return NDIS_STATUS_PENDING. After the client has closed all calls and deregistered all SAPs, the call manager can then close the address family and call <B>NdisCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</B> or <A HREF="103ndisx_7gfm.htm"><B>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</B></A> to notify the client. This is the preferred response.</LI>
</UL>

<P><I>ProtocolCmCloseAf</I> must be written so that it can run at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL.</P>
