<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>After one or more calls to <A HREF="103ndisx_6f02.htm"><B>NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket</B></A>, a connection-oriented NIC driver must call <B>NdisMCoReceiveComplete</B> to notify NDIS that its preceding indications of incoming transfers over the network have completed. The miniport driver's call to <B>NdisMCoReceiveComplete</B> prompts NDIS to notify the client or stand-alone call manager to which NDIS has recently posted the NIC driver's receive indications so that the protocol can begin postprocessing the received data. </P>

<P>When a miniport driver calls <B>NdisMCoReceiveComplete</B>, NDIS indicates the completion of receive operation(s) by calling the protocol's <A HREF="104tdlow_5i7m.htm"><I>ProtocolReceiveComplete</I></A> function. <I>ProtocolReceiveComplete</I> functions do not operate under the severe time constraints of the corresponding <A HREF="104tdlow_3pwy.htm"><I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I></A> functions. However, another receive indication to the <I>ProtocolCoReceivePacket</I> function can come in while the <I>ProtocolReceiveComplete</I> function is running.</P>

<P>A miniport driver need not call <B>NdisMCoReceiveComplete</B> in one-to-one correspondence with its calls to <B>NdisMCoIndicateReceivePacket</B>. That is, the NIC driver can issue a single receive-complete indication for some number of receive indications on a VC, particularly when network traffic is high. At a minimum, a connection-oriented miniport driver must call <B>NdisMCoReceiveComplete</B> at least once from its <A HREF="101mini_7s36.htm"><I>MiniportHandleInterrupt</I></A> function after making one or more receive indications on any particular VC. </P>

<P>Callers of <B>NdisMCoReceiveComplete</B> can be running at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL. </P>
