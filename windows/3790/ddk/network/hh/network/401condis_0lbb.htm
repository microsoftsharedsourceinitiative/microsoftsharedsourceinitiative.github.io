<H3><A NAME="ddk_connection_oriented_operations_performed_by_call_managers_ng"></A>Connection-Oriented Operations Performed by Call Managers</H3>

<P>A call manager performs the following connection-oriented operations:

<UL>
	<LI><B>Registers and deregisters one or more address families</B>
<P>A call manager registers one or more address families with NDIS (see <A HREF="401condis_4grr.htm">Registering and Opening an Address Family</A>). By registering an address family, a call manager registers the entry points of its call manager functions with NDIS and also advertises its call manager services (specifically, a signaling protocol) to bound connection-oriented clients.
</LI>

	<LI><B>Registers and deregisters SAPs at the request of a connection-oriented client</B>
<P>A call manager receives a bound connection-oriented client's requests to register SAPs (see <A HREF="401condis_03qf.htm">Registering a SAP</A>) and to deregister SAPs (see <A HREF="401condis_4jfr.htm">Deregistering a SAP</A>). The call manager sends signaling messages over the network to register or deregister SAPs on behalf of clients.
</LI>

	<LI><B>Sets up an outgoing call at the request of a connection-oriented client</B>
<P>When a connection-oriented client makes an outgoing call, the call manager communicates (exchanges signaling messages) with network control devices, as necessary, to make a connection (see <A HREF="401condis_69yf.htm">Making a Call</A>). If the call is accepted by the remote party, the call manager activates the VC created for the call (see <A HREF="401condis_1wx3.htm">Activating a Call</A>). 
</LI>

	<LI><B>Sets up and indicates an incoming call to a connection-oriented client</B>
<P>A call manager indicates to a bound connection-oriented client all calls addressed to a SAP registered by that client (see <A HREF="401condis_3tyf.htm">Indicating an Incoming Call</A>). Before indicating the incoming call to the client, the call manager initiates creation of a VC for the call (see <A HREF="401condis_0t47.htm">Creating a VC</A>) and then initiates activation of the VC (see <A HREF="401condis_1wx3.htm">Activating a VC</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Communicates requests for a change in QoS</B>
<P>Depending on the signaling protocol, the call manager can communicate a request from the local client to change the QoS for an outgoing or incoming call (see <A HREF="401condis_1j6v.htm">Client-Initiated Request to Change Call Parameters</A>) or a request from the remote party to change the QoS for a call (see <A HREF="401condis_16qv.htm">Incoming Request to Change Call Parameters</A>). 
</LI>

	<LI><B>Communicates requests to add and drop parties</B>
<P>A call manager communicates a local client's request to add a party to or drop a party from a point-to-multipoint call (see <A HREF="401condis_184n.htm">Adding a Party to a Multipoint Call</A> and <A HREF="401condis_8wo7.htm">Dropping a Party from a Multipoint Call</A>). A call manager also communicates a remote party's incoming request to drop itself from a point-to-multipoint call (see <A HREF="401condis_5exz.htm">Incoming Request to Drop a Party from a Multipoint Call</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Tears down a call</B>
<P>At the request of a connection-oriented client, a call manager closes a call by communicating with network control devices to terminate a connection (see <A HREF="401condis_3i07.htm">Client-Initiated Request to Close a Call</A>). At the request of a remote party, a call manager indicates to a local connection-oriented client a remote party's request to close a call (see <A HREF="401condis_0xk7.htm">Incoming Request to Close a Call</A> ). In the process of tearing down a call, the call manager deactivates the VC used for the call (see <A HREF="401condis_3dyf.htm">Deactivating a VC</A>). If the call manager created the VC (for an incoming call), the call manager can also delete the VC (see <A HREF="401condis_3d2f.htm">Deleting a VC</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Queries or sets information</B>
<P>A call manager can query or set information maintained by a bound connection-oriented client (see <A HREF="401condis_9sdj.htm">Querying or Setting Information</A>). A call manager can also respond to query and set operations from a bound connection-oriented client.

<P>In addition, a call manager can query or set information maintained by a bound miniport driver or by the miniport driver portion of a bound MCM driver (see <A HREF="401condis_9sdj.htm">Querying or Setting Information</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Inputs miniport driver status indications</B>
<P>A call manager inputs status indications from a bound connection-oriented miniport driver (see <A HREF="401condis_33s7.htm">Indicating Miniport Driver Status</A>).
</LI>

	<LI><B>Resets a NIC</B>
<P>A call manager can cause a connection-oriented miniport driver to reset its NIC (see <A HREF="401condis_86eg.htm">Reset</A>).
</LI>
