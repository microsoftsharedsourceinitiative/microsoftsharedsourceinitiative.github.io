<P>An NDIS WAN miniport driver sets itself to accept TAPI commands in two steps. When the miniport driver registers with NDIS in its <B>DriverEntry</B> function by calling <A HREF="103ndisx_6tte.htm"><B>NdisMRegisterMiniport</B></A>, it indicates that it requires WAN services by setting the flag NDIS_USE_WAN_WRAPPER in the <B>Reserved</B> member of the NDIS<I>XX</I>_MINIPORT_CHARCTERISTICS structure.</P>

<P>Following execution of the <B>DriverEntry</B> function and after <A HREF="101mini_9jzm.htm"><I>MiniportInitialize</I></A> has been called to complete the initialization of one or more adapters, the NDISWAN driver will make an <A HREF="103ndisx_0u42.htm"><B>NdisRequest</B></A> call to the NDIS WAN miniport driver’s <A HREF="101mini_2vw2.htm"><I>MiniportQueryInformation</I></A> function, with an <A HREF="28wanoid_3302.htm">OID_WAN_GET_INFO</A> request. A miniport driver that is TAPI-capable should set the TAPI_PROVIDER bit of the <B>FramingBits</B> member of the NDIS_WAN_INFO structure passed in this call. </P>

<P>The TAPI-capable NDIS WAN miniport driver sets the <B>MaxTransmit</B> member of the NDIS_WAN_INFO structure to the default maximum number of outstanding send packets the miniport driver will accept. NDIS will hold send packets after this maximum is reached. However, a TAPI-capable miniport driver can dynamically provide a new send window that is different from this initialization-time default value. When the miniport driver indicates a line up status to <A HREF="103ndisx_5nn6.htm"><B>NdisMIndicateStatus</B></A>, it can provide a new nonzero value for that line by setting the <B>SendWindow</B> passed in the NDIS_MAC_LINE_UP structure. If the miniport driver passes a <B>SendWindow</B> of zero, NDISWAN uses the default value, <B>MaxTransmit</B>, that was set at initialization time for that line.</P>

<P>As the WAN driver’s <I>MiniportInitialize</I> is called to initialize each adapter it manages, NDISWAN calls NDISTAPI to register each TAPI-capable adapter. This creates an association that NDISTAPI can use to send telephonic requests through NDISWAN to the miniport driver for specific adapters that have been registered.</P>
