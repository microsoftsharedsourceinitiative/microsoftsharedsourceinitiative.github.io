<P>A connection-oriented protocol driver can transmit one or more packets with the <A HREF="103ndisx_15de.htm"><B>NdisCoSendPackets</B></A> function, passing in a pointer to an array of pointers to one or more packet descriptors. </P>

<P>When a protocol driver calls <B>NdisCoSendPackets</B> to transmit one or more packets, send operations are always asynchronous. The protocol driver relinquishes ownership of the packet resources that it allocated until NDIS returns each packet descriptor and the final status of the send for that packet to <A HREF="104tdlow_2t4i.htm"><I>ProtocolCoSendComplete</I></A>. </P>

<P>As a consequence, on return from <B>NdisCoSendPackets</B>, a protocol driver never reads the <B>Status</B> member in the OOB block associated with a packet descriptor. The protocol driver cannot learn the status of its send request in this manner because the <B>Status</B> member is in use by NDIS. NDIS uses the <B>Status</B> member to track the progress of an in-transition send request and it is volatile until NDIS returns the packet descriptor to <I>ProtocolCoSendComplete</I>. A protocol driver always obtains the status of a transmit request from the <I>Status</I> parameter passed to <I>ProtocolCoSendComplete</I>.</P>

<P>A protocol driver can request the transmission of an array of packets of different priorities by arranging the packets it receives from clients. The protocol driver should place the highest priority packets at the beginning of the array. NDIS always preserves the order of packets in any array passed to <A HREF="103ndisx_15de.htm"><B>NdisCoSendPackets</B></A>.</P>

<P>NDIS does not attempt to examine and make queuing decisions based on any of the OOB data associated with the packet descriptors given to <B>NdisCoSendPackets</B>. Unless a protocol driver can determine the manner in which the underlying miniport driver handles packet priorities or the <B>TimeToSend</B> time stamps, the protocol driver should proceed as if the underlying miniport driver transmits all packets in the order in which it receives them. Consequently, a protocol driver should order the packet arrays it sends according to the order in which those packets should be transmitted over the network. </P>
