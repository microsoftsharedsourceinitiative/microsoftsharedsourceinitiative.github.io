<P><B>Note:</B> vendor-supplied network upgrades are not supported in Windows XP (SP1 and later), Windows Server 2003, and later operating systems.</P>

<P>The user or system administrator starts the upgrade process by taking either of the following actions:

<UL>
	<LI>Selecting the component upgrade in the user interface that is displayed after the Windows&nbsp;2000 or later CD-ROM spins up</LI>

	<LI>Selecting and running <I>\i386\winnt32.exe</I> on the CD-ROM</LI>
</UL>

<P>If the user or system administrator has set the NETUPGRD_INIT_FILE_DIR environment variable on the system being upgraded, NetSetup searches for a <A HREF="503upgrade_4rfr.htm"><I>netupg.inf</I></A> file in the directory specified by that variable. The <I>netupg.inf</I> file contains only one section: <B>OemNetUpgradeDirs</B>. Each entry in this section specifies the complete path to a directory that contains the vendor-supplied upgrade files, including a <A HREF="503upgrade_2f6v.htm"><I>netmap.inf</I></A> file, for a network component. If the NETUPGRD_INIT_FILE_DIR environment variable is not set, NetSetup (<I>netupgrd.dll</I>) looks for <I>netmap.inf</I> files in its own directory.</P>

<P>NetSetup reads the <I>netmap.inf</I> files to identify the network components that do not have built-in upgrade support. If NetSetup is running in unattended mode, it displays a wizard; however, the user or system administrator cannot use the wizard. If NetSetup is not running in unattended mode, the wizard displays a list of the network components that do not have built-in upgrade support. </P>

<P>Using the wizard, a user or system administrator can:

<UL>
	<LI>Click <B>Cancel</B> to abort the installation of the operating system.</LI>

	<LI>Click <B>Next</B> to install the operating system without upgrading the listed network components.</LI>

	<LI>Specify the drive and directory location of vendor-supplied upgrade files for listed network components. 
<P class=indent1>NetSetup reads the <I>netmap.inf</I> file at the specified location and copies the vendor-supplied upgrade files at that location to a temporary directory on the system's hard disk. This temporary directory becomes the working directory for the vendor-supplied network migration DLL. NetSetup also removes any component that has a <I>netmap.inf</I> file from the component list in the wizard.</P>

<P>A user can chose to upgrade only a subset of the network components listed in the wizard. At any time, the user can click <B>Next</B> to avoid upgrading the remaining listed network components. This action continues the installation of the operating system. The user can also click <B>Cancel</B> at any time to abort the installation of the operating system.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>NetSetup generates the <I>winnt.sif</I> file (also known as the AnswerFile) in the <I>$Win_nt$.~bt</I> directory, which is usually located on the C: drive. </P>

<P>NetSetup generates the AnswerFile as follows:

<OL>
	<LI>NetSetup reads the registry of the preupgraded system to enumerate each network component. For each network component that has built-in upgrade support, NetSetup writes the information that is read from the registry to the AnswerFile.</LI>

	<LI>For each network component that does not have built-in upgrade support, NetSetup reads the component's <I>netmap.inf</I> file. The <I>netmap.inf</I> file maps the preupgrade device, hardware, or compatible ID of a network component to the corresponding ID in the upgraded operating system. If NetSetup matches the preupgrade ID of the network component that it read from the registry with a preupgrade ID in the <B>OemNetAdapters</B>, <B>OemNetProtocols</B>, <B>OemNetServices</B>, or <B>OemAsyncAdapters</B> section of the <I>netmap.inf</I> file, NetSetup writes vendor-provided information for the component to the AnswerFile.</LI>

	<LI>Using the component's operating system device, hardware, or compatible ID, NetSetup reads the <B>OemUpgradeSupport</B> section of the <I>netmap.inf</I> file to determine which network migration DLL to load. NetSetup then loads the network migration DLL, and calls the DLL's <A HREF="upgrade_3jzm.htm"><B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B></A> function. The <B>PreUpgradeInitialize</B> function supplies information that the DLL uses to initialize itself.</LI>

	<LI>NetSetup calls the DLL's <A HREF="upgrade_5kaa.htm"><B>DoPreUpgradeProcessing</B></A> function once for each network component supported by the network migration DLL.  <B>DoPreUpgradeProcessing</B> reads a network component's preupgrade parameter values from the registry and calls the <A HREF="upgrade_5gc2.htm"><B>NetUpgradeAddSection</B></A> and <A HREF="upgrade_1n5e.htm"><B>NetUpgradeAddLineToSection</B></A> functions to write these parameters, along with other component-specific information, to the AnswerFile. <B>DoPreUpgradeProcessing</B> can also migrate binary data associated with the preupgraded component by making appropriate entries in the AnswerFile.</LI>

	<LI>After the AnswerFile is completely generated, NetSetup copies the vendor-supplied upgrade files to the appropriate directories and then boots into the text mode phase of the upgrade process.</LI>
