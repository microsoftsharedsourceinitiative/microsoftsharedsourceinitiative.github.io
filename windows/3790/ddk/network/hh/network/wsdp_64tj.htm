<P>The Windows Sockets switch always uses the AF_INET address family to interact with a SAN service provider, not the SAN’s native address family. Therefore, a proxy driver for a SAN service provider must translate between AF_INET addresses and native addresses accordingly. </P>

<P>A proxy driver uses TDI Plug and Play (PnP) notifications to maintain the list of IP addresses assigned to each NIC under its control, as described in <A HREF="wsdp_2mw7.htm">Registering for SAN NIC Notifications</A>. The proxy driver uses this list to translate between native SAN addresses and IP addresses. </P>

<P>The proxy driver receives requests from its SAN service provider that contain IP addresses. These requests include, for example, the request to bind to a specific NIC and the request to connect to a remote peer. The proxy driver must translate to native SAN addresses to complete these requests. The proxy driver also receives incoming connection requests from remote peers that contain SAN native addresses of those remote peers. The proxy driver must translate to the IP addresses of those remote peers to complete these requests. </P>
