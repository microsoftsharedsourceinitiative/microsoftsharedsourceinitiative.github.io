<P>The OID_802_11_STATISTICS OID requests the miniport driver to return the current statistics for the 802.11 interface. These statistics are described by an NDIS_802_11_STATISTICS structure, defined as follows: </P>

<PRE class=syntax>typedef struct _NDIS_802_11_STATISTICS 
{
 ULONG Length; 
 LARGE_INTEGER TransmittedFragmentCount;
 LARGE_INTEGER MulticastTransmittedFrameCount;
 LARGE_INTEGER FailedCount;
 LARGE_INTEGER RetryCount;
 LARGE_INTEGER MultipleRetryCount;
 LARGE_INTEGER RTSSuccessCount;
 LARGE_INTEGER RTSFailureCount;
 LARGE_INTEGER ACKFailureCount;
 LARGE_INTEGER FrameDuplicateCount;
 LARGE_INTEGER ReceivedFragmentCount;
 LARGE_INTEGER MulticastReceivedFrameCount;
 LARGE_INTEGER FCSErrorCount;
} NDIS_802_11_STATISTICS, *PNDIS_802_11_STATISTICS;

<P>The members of this structure contain the following information:

<DL>
<DT><B>Length</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the length of the NDIS_802_11_STATISTICS structure in bytes. </DD>

<DT><B>TransmittedFragmentCount</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of data and management fragments that the NIC has successfully transmitted. </DD>

<DT><B>MulticastTransmittedFrameCount</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of frames that the NIC has transmitted by multicast or broadcast. This count is incremented each time that the multicast/broadcast bit is set in the destination MAC address of a transmitted frame.</DD>

<DT><B>FailedCount</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of NIC frame transmissions that failed after exceeding either the short frame or the long frame retry limits. </DD>

<DT><B>RetryCount</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of frames that the NIC successfully retransmitted after one or more retransmission attempts. </DD>

<DT><B>MultipleRetryCount</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of frames that the NIC successfully retransmitted after more than one retransmission attempt. </DD>

<DT><B>RTSSuccessCount</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of times that the NIC received a CTS in response to an RTS. </DD>

<DT><B>RTSFailureCount</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of times that the NIC did not receive a CTS in response to an RTS. </DD>

<DT><B>ACKFailureCount</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of times that the NIC expected an ACK that was not received. </DD>

<DT><B>FrameDuplicateCount</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of duplicate frames that were received. The sequence control field in the frameidentifies duplicate frames.</DD>

<DT><B>ReceivedFragmentCount</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of data and management fragments that the NIC has successfully received. This count is incremented each time that either a data fragment or a management fragment is received.</DD>

<DT><B>MulticastReceivedFrameCount</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of received frames that were set to multicast or broadcast. This count is incremented each time the NIC receives a frame with the multicast/broadcast bit set in the destination MAC address.</DD>

<DT><B>FCSErrorCount</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of frames the NIC received that contained FCS errors.
