<P>A connection-oriented client that serves as the root of a multipoint call must eventually drop each party from that call with <A HREF="103ndisx_2tf6.htm"><B>NdisClDropParty</B></A> or <A HREF="103ndisx_7rsi.htm"><B>NdisClCloseCall</B></A>.</P>

<P>A client drops a party from a call in the following situations:

<UL>
	<LI>Before initiating the tear down of a multipoint call with <B>NdisClCloseCall</B> (see <A HREF="401condis_3i07.htm">Client-Initiated Request to Close a Call</A>), a client must drop all but the last party with successive calls to <B>NdisClDropParty</B>. The client specifies the last party to drop from the call with <B>NdisClCloseCall</B>.</LI>

	<LI>In response to a remote party's request to be dropped from a multipoint call (see <A HREF="401condis_5exz.htm">Incoming Request to Drop a Party from a Multipoint Call</A>), a client, from its <A HREF="104tdlow_8pde.htm"><I>ProtocolClIncomingDropParty</I></A> function, calls <B>NdisClDropParty</B>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>A client's call to <B>NdisClDropParty</B> causes NDIS to call the <A HREF="104tdlow_3koi.htm"><I>ProtocolCmDropParty</I></A> function of the call manager or MCM driver that shares the same <I>NdisVcHandle</I> to the multipoint VC. </P>

<P>The following figure shows the client of a call manager requesting to drop a party from a multipoint call.</P>

<P>The next figure shows the client of a call manager requesting to drop a party from a multipoint call.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/fig1_18.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><B>Dropping a Party From a Multipoint Call Through an MCM Driver</B></P>

<P><I>ProtocolCmDropParty </I>communicates with network control devices to drop a party from an existing multipoint call. NDIS can pass to <I>ProtocolCmDropParty</I> a pointer to a buffer containing data (supplied to the client in the call to <B>NdisClDropParty</B>). <I>ProtocolCmDropParty</I> must send any such data across the network before the connection is dropped.</P>

<P><I>ProtocolCmDropParty</I> can complete synchronously, or more probably, asynchronously with <A HREF="103ndisx_7rsj.htm"><B>NdisCmDropPartyComplete</B></A>, in the case of a call manager, or <A HREF="103ndisx_0yya.htm"><B>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</B></A>, in the case of an MCM driver.</P>

<P>The call to <B>Ndis(M)CmDropPartyComplete</B> causes NDIS to call the client's <A HREF="104tdlow_07ea.htm"><I>ProtocolClDropPartyComplete</I></A> function. If the client is in the process of tearing down a multipoint VC that it created, <I>ProtocolClDropPartyComplete</I> can call <B>NdisClDropParty</B> with any valid <I>NdisPartyHandle</I> to one of the remaining parties on the client's active multipoint VC. If only one party remains on its multipoint VC, the client should drop that party by passing its <I>NdisPartyHandle</I> to <B>NdisClCloseCall</B> (see <A HREF="401condis_3i07.htm">Client-Initiated Request to Close a Call</A>).</P>
