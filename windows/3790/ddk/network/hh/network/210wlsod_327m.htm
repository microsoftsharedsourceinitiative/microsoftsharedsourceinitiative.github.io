<P>The OID_WW_GEN_SIM_STATUS OID requests an underlying miniport driver to return information that specifies if its NIC has an attached Subscriber Information Module (SIM). This OID also requests information about the SIM and if a Personal Identification Number (PIN) is required to be entered for the SIM in order to access the NIC. A PIN is also known as a password. This OID is defined as OPTIONAL.</P>

<P>This request uses a WW_SIM_STATUS structure, defined as follows:</P>

<PRE class=syntax>typedef struct _WW_SIM_STATUS {
  <B>OUT </B>BOOLEAN  bHasSIM; 
  <B>OUT </B>BOOLEAN  bBlocked; 
  <B>OUT </B>BOOLEAN  bLocked; 
  <B>OUT </B>BOOLEAN  bInitialized; 
  <B>OUT </B>UINT  uCountdown; 
} WW_SIM_STATUS;
</PRE>

<P>The members of this structure contain the following information:

<DL>
<DT><B>bHasSIM</B></DT>

<DD>Boolean value that is TRUE if the underlying miniport driver requires a SIM to access the NIC and FALSE if the NIC does not use a SIM. </DD>

<DT><B>bBlocked</B></DT>

<DD>Boolean value that is TRUE if access to the SIM using a PIN is blocked and FALSE if a PIN can unlock the SIM. </DD>

<DT><B>bLocked</B></DT>

<DD>Boolean value that is TRUE if the underlying miniport driver requires a PIN to be entered for the SIM in order to access the NIC and FALSE if a PIN is not required. </DD>

<DT><B>bInitialized</B></DT>

<DD>Boolean value that is TRUE if the SIM has already been initialized with a PIN and FALSE if a PIN has never been set for the SIM. </DD>

<DT><B>uCountdown</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the remaining number of attempts that are available to users to enter the correct PIN. If this value is zero and a PIN is required as specified by <B>bLocked</B>, users can no longer enter a PIN. In this case, the NIC's SIM must either be returned for unlocking service or, if implemented, <A HREF="210wlsod_6sj6.htm">OID_WW_GEN_SIM_PUK</A> must be used to reset <B>uCountDown</B> to enable further attempts for entering the correct PIN.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>SIMs are sometimes also referred to as smart cards. SIMs are used in wireless telephones that are based on both Global System for Mobile (GSM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communications standards. SIMs identify call plans and other phone information for individuals. Therefore, call plans and other phone information are linked to SIMs and not phones. For example, if an individual buys a new wireless phone and both his new and old wireless phones support compatible SIMs, he is not required to contact his wireless service provider. He simply must remove the SIM from his old phone and insert it into his new phone. His phone number, permissions, and service plans are then transferred to his new phone.</P>

<P>SIMs have a security feature whereby they can lock their associated phones until users enter their PINs on keypads for the phones. This OID was introduced as a solution for devices that do not have keypads such as computer cards. Until this OID was introduced, there was no programmatic mechanism provided to unlock a SIM.</P>

<P>Sets and indications are irrelevant for this OID.</P>
