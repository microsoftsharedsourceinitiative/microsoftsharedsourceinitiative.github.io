<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>After any FDDI receive indication, a miniport driver eventually must call <B>NdisMFddiIndicateReceiveComplete</B> to indicate the end of the transfer operation over the net, even if a particular packet is accepted by no bound protocol. </P>

<P><B>NdisMFddiIndicateReceiveComplete</B> both indicates the completion of a transfer operation for a receive and notifies any bound protocol that has already consumed the initial indication that it can begin postprocessing the received data. </P>

<P>When a miniport driver calls <B>NdisMFddiIndicateReceiveComplete</B>, NDIS indicates the completion of the receive operation to each such protocol by calling its <A HREF="104tdlow_5i7m.htm"><I>ProtocolReceiveComplete</I></A> function. </P>

<P><I>ProtocolReceiveComplete</I> functions need not operate under the severe time constraints of the corresponding <A HREF="104tdlow_62k2.htm"><I>ProtocolReceive</I></A> functions. However, another receive indication to the <I>ProtocolReceive</I> function can come in while the <I>ProtocolReceiveComplete</I> function is running. </P>

<P>A miniport driver need not call <B>NdisMFddiIndicateReceiveComplete</B> in one-to-one correspondence with its calls to <B>NdisMFddiIndicateReceive</B>. That is, a NIC driver can issue a single receive-complete indication for some number of receive indications, particularly when network traffic is high. For example, when a miniport driver is continually indicating receives from the same source, it might call <B>NdisMFddiIndicateReceiveComplete</B> once for every ten indications. On the other hand, a miniport driver might call <B>NdisMFddiIndicateReceiveComplete</B> once for each indication when network traffic is low so that the driver can regain ownership of the memory it allocated for receives promptly. However, a miniport driver must call <B>NdisMFddiIndicateReceiveComplete</B> at least once per batch of packets indicated from its <A HREF="101mini_7s36.htm"><I>MiniportHandleInterrupt</I></A> function. </P>

<P>Serialized callers of <B>NdisMFddiIndicateReceiveComplete</B> run at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL. Deserialized callers of <B>NdisMFddiIndicateReceiveComplete</B> can run at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.</P>
