<P>The OID_WAN_CURRENT_ADDRESS OID requests the miniport driver to return the address that the NIC currently is using.</P>

<P>The miniport driver should return a unique address for the target NIC. NDISWAN presents the returned value, formatted as an Ethernet address, to higher-level protocols. Consequently, the least-significant bit must not be set in such a returned NIC-specific address to prevent it from being interpreted as an Ethernet multicast address. </P>

<P>The driver of a NIC manufactured by a vendor with an assigned Ethernet ID should use that ID as part of the address it returns for this OID. This prevents conflicts with other vendors’ assigned Ethernet address ranges.</P>
