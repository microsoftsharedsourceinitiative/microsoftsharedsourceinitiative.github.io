<H4>Operation</H4>

<P>This IOCTL returns triples that consist of a persistent symbolic link name for the volume (that is a mount point), a unique ID for the volume, and a nonpersistent device name (such as "\Device\HarddiskVolume1") for the volume. The input to this IOCTL is a <A HREF="k306_30ky.htm">MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT</A> structure containing a single triple where at least one of the three fields must be present. The Mount Manager returns triples for all mount points corresponding to the volume indicated in the input triple.</P>

<P>If a symbolic link is present in the input triple, Mount Manager queries the client for the nonpersistent device name corresponding to the symbolic link in the input, and then uses the device name to locate other symbolic links in the mounted device list that are associated with the volume.</P>

<P>If there is no symbolic link in the input triple, but the unique ID is present, the Mount Manager uses the unique ID to search the mounted device list. If both the symbolic link and the unique ID are omitted, the Mount Manager uses the nonpersistent device name in the input triple to search the list.</P>

<H4>Input</H4>

<P><B>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</B> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the input buffer, which must be greater than or equal to <B>sizeof</B>(MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT).</P>

<P>The Mount Manager client initializes the <A HREF="k306_30ky.htm">MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT</A> structure, defined in <I>mountmgr.h</I>, at the beginning of the buffer at <B>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</B>. Immediately following this structure, the MM client loads the symbolic link name, the unique ID and the device name, in that order.</P>

<H4>Output</H4>

<P>The Mount Manager initializes a variable-length structure of type <A HREF="k306_4che.htm">MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINTS</A>, defined in <I>mountmgr.h</I>, at the beginning of the buffer at <B>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</B>. The Mount Manager inserts the mount points, associated with the indicated volume, at the address pointed to by the <I>MountPoints[]</I> member of this structure. Each mount point is represented by MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT structure as defined in the <B>Input</B> section for this IOCTL.</P>

<H4>I/O Status Block</H4>

<P>If the operation is successful, the <B>Status</B> field is set to STATUS_SUCCESS.</P>

<P>If neither the unique ID nor the nonpersistent device name are found in the volumes mounted device list, the <B>Status</B> field is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.</P>

<P>If <B>InputBufferLength</B> is less than <B>sizeof</B>(MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT), the <B>Status</B> field is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.</P>

<P>If <B>InputBufferLength</B> is less than the total length of the three input ID strings, the <B>Status</B> field is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.</P>

<P>If <B>OutputBufferLength</B> is less than <B>sizeof</B>(MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT), the <B>Status</B> field is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.</P>

<P>If <B>OutputBufferLength</B> is less than <B>sizeof</B>(MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINTS) plus the sum of the sizes of the mount point triples, the <B>Status</B> field is set to STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW.</P>

<P>If any of the three strings contained within any of the triples is aligned on an odd address (for example, address &amp; 01 != 0), the <B>Status</B> field is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.</P>
