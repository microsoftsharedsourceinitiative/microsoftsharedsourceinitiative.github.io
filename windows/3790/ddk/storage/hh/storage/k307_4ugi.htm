<P>The Mount Manager publishes an interface that client drivers, such as class drivers, must support in order to receive persistent symbolic link names from the Mount Manager. Mount Manager client drivers register to receive the IOCTLs listed in this section from the Mount Manager by calling <B>IoRegisterDeviceInterface</B> with the MOUNTDEV_MOUNTED_DEVICE_GUID GUID defined in <I>mountmgr.h</I>. Any driver that subscribes to this interface must support some subset of these IOCTLs. To determine whether a specific IOCTL is required, check the <B>Operation</B> section of the IOCTL. </P>
