<P>A storage miniport driver for a SCSI boot device is subject to special restrictions during a system crash. While dumping the system's memory image to disk, the miniport driver for the boot device must operate within a different environment. The usual communication between the miniport, the port driver and disk class driver is interrupted. The kernel does disk I/O by direct calls to the disk dump driver, <I>diskdump.sys</I>, bypassing filesystems, and the normal I/O stack. The disk dump driver, in turn, calls the boot device's miniport driver to handle all I/O operations, and the disk dump driver intercepts all of the miniports calls to the port driver. </P>

<P>The disk dump driver provides the same set of support routines that the SCSI port driver provides, so the miniport driver should be able to use disk dump driver routines in the same way that it uses SCSI port routines.</P>

<P>However, miniports must make frugal use of memory during the a system crash. The amount of non-cached memory that the miniport driver can allocate for its device and driver extensions is extremely limited. The miniport should not attempt to allocate more than 32 kilobytes of memory. </P>
