<H4>Operation</H4>

<P>Allows an application to send almost any SCSI command to a target device, with the following restrictions:

<UL>
	<LI>Multitarget commands, such as COPY, are not allowed.</LI>

	<LI>Bidirectional data transfer operations are not supported.</LI>

	<LI>If a class driver for the target type of device exists, the request must be sent to that class driver. Thus, an application can send this request directly to the system port driver for a target logical unit only if there is no class driver for the type of device connected to that LU.</LI>

	<LI>This request <I>must</I> be made if the input CDB might require the underlying miniport driver to access memory directly.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The calling application creates the SCSI command descriptor block, which can include a request for request-sense data if a CHECK CONDITION occurs. If the CDB requests a data transfer operation, the caller must set up a cache-aligned buffer from which or into which the miniport driver can transfer data directly. This request is typically used for transferring larger amounts of data (&gt;16K).</P>

<H4>Input</H4>

<P><B>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</B> indicates the size in bytes of the buffer at <B>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</B>, which must be at least (<I>RequestSenseStorageSize</I> + <B>sizeof</B> (SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT)). The size of the <A HREF="k306_3qnm.htm">SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</A> structure is fixed.</P>

<P>This structure includes a SCSI CDB, which must be initialized by the caller except for the path, target ID, and LUN, which are filled in by the port driver. For a data-out command, the data to be transferred must be in a cache-aligned buffer. The <B>DataBuffer</B> member of SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT is a pointer to this cache-aligned buffer. The caller must allocate additional storage, following the SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT structure, if the caller asks for request-sense data.</P>

<H4>Output</H4>

<P>The port driver returns any request-sense data and the SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT structure to the buffer at <B>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</B>. The <B>SenseInfoLength</B> and <B>DataTransferLength</B> are updated to indicate the amount of data transferred. The port driver returns any data transferred from the device to the supplied cache-aligned buffer at <B>DataBuffer</B>.</P>

<H4>I/O Status Block</H4>

<P>The <B>Information</B> field is set to the number of bytes returned in the output buffer at <B>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</B>. The <B>Status</B> field is set to STATUS_SUCCESS, or possibly to STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL or STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER if the input <B>Length</B> value in SCSI_PASS_THROUGH is improperly set. </P>

<H4>Headers</H4>
