<P>Every SCSI miniport driver must have at least the following system-defined routines: 

<UL>
	<LI><B>DriverEntry</B> to initialize the miniport driver </LI>

	<LI><I>HwScsiFindAdapter</I> to determine how (or whether) driver-supported HBA(s) are configured in the machine </LI>

	<LI><I>HwScsiInitialize</I> to initialize supported HBA(s) </LI>

	<LI><I>HwScsiStartIo</I> to start operations on its HBA(s) for incoming requests </LI>

	<LI><I>HwScsiResetBus</I> to handle bus reset requests </LI>
</UL>

<P>Depending on each HBA and the driver designer, SCSI miniport drivers also have some or all of the following system-defined routines: 

<UL>
	<LI><I>HwScsiInterrupt</I> to handle HBA-generated interrupts, which is optional if and only if the HBA does not generate interrupts so the miniport manages all I/O operations on its HBA by polling 
<P>However, using polling exclusively has an adverse effect on a miniport’s performance and on its HBA’s I/O throughput. Such a miniport driver should also have an <I>HwScsiTimer</I> routine. 
</LI>

	<LI><I>HwScsiDisableInterruptsCallback</I> and <I>HwScsiEnableInterruptsCallback</I> to handle deferred I/O processing if interrupt-driven I/O operations take a long time </LI>

	<LI><I>HwScsiTimer</I> to time operations that require long delays on the HBA, or for any other purpose determined by the driver designer
<P>A miniport should have a <I>HwScsiTimer</I> routine if it has no <I>HwScsiInterrupt</I> routine so it can use the <I>HwScsiTimer</I> routine for efficient polling of its HBA. 
</LI>

	<LI><I>HwScsiDmaStarted</I>, which is required if the HBA uses a system DMA controller, to set up an HBA transfer after the system DMA controller has been programmed by the port driver </LI>

	<LI><I>HwScsiAdapterState</I>, which is optional if and only if the HBA has no BIOS or x86-real-mode driver and/or will never run in x86-only Microsoft Windows systems </LI>

	<LI><I>HwScsiAdapterControl</I>, which is required if the miniport driver supports Plug and Play</LI>
</UL>

<P>Each of the preceding miniport driver routines, except <B>DriverEntry</B>, has a name chosen to describe its functionality. Except for <B>DriverEntry</B>, which is a required name for every miniport’s initial entry point, names for miniport driver routines can be anything the driver writer chooses. </P>

<P>The following sections describe the requirements for and functionality of each of these miniport driver routines. See <A HREF="k302_49iq.htm">SCSI Miniport Driver Routines</A> for their formal definitions and descriptions of their parameters. </P>

<P><A HREF="02mnport_0svb.htm">Error Handling in SCSI Miniport Drivers</A> describes error-handling requirements for SCSI miniport drivers. </P>
