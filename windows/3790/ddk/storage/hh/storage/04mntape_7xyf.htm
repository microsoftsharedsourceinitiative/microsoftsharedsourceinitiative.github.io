<P>The system-supplied tape class driver implements device-independent, operating system-specific tape support and exports support routines for device-specific tape miniclass drivers.</P>

<P>The tape class driver:

<UL>
	<LI>Initializes the tape miniclass driver using device-specific information provided by the miniclass driver's <B>DriverEntry</B> routine, including allocating and initializing operating system resources for the miniclass driver and the devices it supports, creating a device object (FDO) to represent the device and attaching it to the device stack, and starting the device on receipt of a start request from the PnP Manager.</LI>

	<LI>Exports memory allocation and initialization routines.</LI>

	<LI>Splits transfer requests when necessary to fit within the maximum transfer size for the HBA.</LI>

	<LI>Handles IRP_MJ_CREATE, IRP_MJ_READ, IRP_MJ_WRITE, IRP_MJ_PNP, and IRP_MJ_POWER requests.</LI>

	<LI>Performs device-independent preprocessing for IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL requests and dispatches to the corresponding device-specific routines in the tape miniclass drivers.</LI>

	<LI>Allocates SRBs and sends them to the underlying storage port driver after the tape miniclass driver has filled in the CDB and any other SRB members appropriate to the request.</LI>

	<LI>Translates between Windows NT status codes and tape status codes, provides device-independent tape-specific error handing, and calls the tape miniclass driver's device-specific error handling routines.</LI>

	<LI>Allocates driver context areas for tape miniclass drivers (minitape extension and command extension).</LI>
</UL>

<P>See <A HREF="k303_53xu.htm">Tape Class Driver Routines</A> for descriptions of the <B>TapeClass</B><I>Xxx</I> routines that can be called by a tape miniclass driver.</P>
