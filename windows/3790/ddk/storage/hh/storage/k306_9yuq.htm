<DL>
<DT><B>Size</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the size of this structure, in bytes, as returned by <B>sizeof</B>(). In effect, this member indicates the version of this structure being used by the miniclass driver. </DD>

<DT><B>NumberTransportElements</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of transport elements in the changer. For a SCSI changer, this is defined in the element address page. This value is almost always 1, because most changers have a single transport element, which can have one or two picker mechanisms. A changer that has two picker mechanisms on its transport must not be represented as having two transports, because pickers cannot be addressed individually. High-end media libraries can have dual and multiple transport elements for fault tolerance.</DD>

<DT><B>NumberStorageElements</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of storage elements (slots) in the changer. For a SCSI changer, this is defined in the element address page. This value represents the maximum number of slots available for this changer, including those in removable magazines, whether or not the magazines are installed. If <B>NumberCleanerSlots</B> is 1, then <B>NumberStorageElements</B> is 1 less than the maximum number of slots in the changer.</DD>

<DT><B>NumberCleanerSlots</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of storage elements (slots) for cleaner cartridges in the changer. For a SCSI changer, this value is not reported in mode sense data, so the miniclass driver must provide it. The miniclass driver should set <B>NumberCleanerSlots</B> to 1 only if the operator's guide for the changer identifies a specific slot as a cleaner slot. If <B>NumberCleanerSlots</B> is 1, then <B>FirstCleanerSlotAddress</B> indicates the zero-based address of the slot in which a drive cleaner should be inserted. If the changer does not support drive cleaning by programmatically moving the cleaner cartridge from its slot to a drive, the miniclass driver must set <B>NumberCleanerSlots</B> to 0. <B>NumberCleanerSlots</B> must not be greater than 1. </DD>

<DT><B>NumberIEElements</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of IEport elements the changer has for inserting and ejecting of media. For a SCSI changer, this is defined in the element address page. An IEport element must not be part of the storage element (slot) space, and it must be possible to transport media between the IEport and a slot using a MOVE MEDIUM SCSI command. If the changer has a door and not a true IEport, the miniclass driver must set <B>NumberIEElements</B> to 0. </DD>

<DT><B>NumberDataTransferElements</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of data transfer elements (drives) in the changer. For a SCSI changer, this is defined in the element address page. Unlike <B>NumberStorageElements</B>, which indicates the total number of possible slots whether or not the slots are actually present, <B>NumberDataTransferElements</B> indicates the number of drives that are actually present in the changer.</DD>

<DT><B>NumberOfDoors</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of doors that the changer has. For a SCSI changer, this value is not reported in mode sense data, so the miniclass driver must provide it. A door provides access to all media in the changer at once, unlike an IEport which provides access to one or more, but not all, media. A changer's door can be a physical front door or a single magazine that contains all media. If a changer supports only an IEport for inserting and ejecting media, the <B>NumberOfDoors</B> must be 0.</DD>

<DT><B>FirstSlotNumber</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number used by the changer vendor to identify the first storage element (slot) in the changer to the end user, either by marking a magazine or by defining a slot numbering scheme in the changer's operators guide. <B>FirstSlotNumber</B> is typically 0 or 1, but it can be the first address in a consecutive range of slot addresses defined by the vendor. </DD>

<DT><B>FirstDriveNumber</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number used by the changer vendor to identify the first data transfer element (drive) in the changer to the end user. <B>FirstDriveNumber</B> is typically 0 or 1, but it can be the first address in a consecutive range of drive addresses defined by the vendor. </DD>

<DT><B>FirstTransportNumber</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number used by the changer vendor to identify the first (and usually only) transport element in the changer to the end user. <B>FirstTransportNumber</B> is typically 0 or 1, but it can be the first address in a consecutive range of transport addresses defined by the vendor. </DD>

<DT><B>FirstIEPortNumber</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number used by the changer vendor to identify the first (and usually only) IEport in the changer to the end user. <B>FirstIEPortNumber</B> is typically 0 or 1, but it can be the first address in a consecutive range of IEport addresses defined by the vendor. If <B>NumberIEElements</B> is 0, <B>FirstIEPortNumber</B> must also be 0.</DD>

<DT><B>FirstCleanerSlotAddress</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number used by the changer vendor to identify the first (and only) slot address assigned to a drive cleaner cartridge to the end user. This must be the value defined by the vendor in the changer's operators guide. For example, if a changer has 8 slots numbered 1 through 8 and its operator's guide designates slot 8 as the drive cleaner slot, <B>FirstSlotNumber</B> would be 1 and <B>FirstCleanerSlotAddress</B> would be 8. If the same 8 slots were numbered 0 through 7, <B>FirstSlotNumber</B> would be 0 and <B>FirstCleanerSlotAddress</B> would be 7. If <B>NumberCleanerSlots</B> is 0, <B>FirstCleanerSlotAddress</B> must be 0.</DD>

<DT><B>MagazineSize</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the number of slots in the removable magazines in the changer. This member is valid only if CHANGER_CARTRIDGE_MAGAZINE is set in <B>Features0</B>.</DD>

<DT><B>DriveCleanTimeout</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates twice the maximum number of seconds a cleaning is expected to take. The changer's drives should be cleaned by its cleaner cartridge in half the time specified by <B>DriveCleanTimeout</B>. For example, if a drive is typically cleaned in 300 seconds (5 minutes), <B>DriveCleanTimeout</B> should be set to 600.</DD>

<DT><B>Features0</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the features supported by the changer. This member can have one or more of the following values bitwise ORed together.
