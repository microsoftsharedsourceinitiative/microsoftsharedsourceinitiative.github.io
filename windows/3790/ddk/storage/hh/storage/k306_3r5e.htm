<DT><B>ISOVersion</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the ISO version of the inquiry data standard that this data conforms to. For more information on the version values allowed in this field, see the <I>SCSI Primary Commands - 2 (SPC-2)</I> specification. </DD>

<DT><B>ResponseDataFormat</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the SCSI standard that governs the response data format. The value of this member must be 2. </DD>

<DT><B>HiSupport</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates, when zero, that the target does not use the hierarchical addressing model to assign LUNs to logical units. A value of 1 indicates the target uses the hierarchical addressing model to assign LUNs to logical units. </DD>

<DT><B>NormACA</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates, when set to one, that the operating system supports setting the NACA bit to one in the control byte of the command descriptor block (CDB). A value of zero indicates that the system does not support setting the NACA bit to one. For more information on the function of the NACA bit and the control byte in a CDB, see the <I>SCSI Primary Commands - 2 (SPC-2)</I> specification. </DD>

<DT><B>TerminateTask</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates, when set to one, that the target device supports the SCSI TERMINATE TASK task management function. A value of zero indicates that the target device does not support the TERMINATE TASK task management function. </DD>

<DT><B>AERC</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates, when set to one, that the target device supports the asynchronous event reporting capability. A value of zero indicates that the target device does not support asynchronous event reports. Details of the asynchronous event reporting support are protocol-specific. For more information on asynchronous even reporting, see the <I>SCSI Primary Commands - 2 (SPC-2)</I> specification. </DD>

<DT><B>AdditionalLength</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the length in bytes of the parameters of the command descriptor block (CDB). </DD>

<DT><B>Reserved</B></DT>

<DD>Reserved. </DD>

<DT><B>Addr16</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates, when set to one, that the target supports 16-bit wide SCSI addresses. A value of zero indicates that the device does not support 32-bit wide SCSI addresses. </DD>

<DT><B>Addr32</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates, when set to one, that the target supports 32-bit wide SCSI addresses. A value of zero indicates that the device does not support 32-bit wide SCSI addresses. </DD>

<DT><B>AckReqQ</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates, when set to one, that the target supports a request and acknowledge data transfer handshake on the secondary bus. A value of zero indicates that the target does not support this function. </DD>

<DT><B>MediumChanger</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates, when set to one, that the device is embedded within or attached to a medium transport element. A value of zero indicates that the device is not embedded within or attached to a medium transport element.</DD>

<DT><B>MultiPort</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates, when set to one, that the target device is a multiport (2 or more ports) device that conforms to the SCSI-3 multiport device requirements. A value of zero indicates that this device has a single port and does not implement the multiport requirements. </DD>

<DT><B>ReservedBit2</B></DT>

<DD>Reserved. </DD>

<DT><B>CommandQueue</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates, when set to one, that the target device supports command queuing for this logical unit. However, a value of zero does not necessarily indicate that the target device does not support command queueing. The meaning of these values depends on the values present in the SCSI inquiry data. For information on the meaning of the command queueing bit, see the <I>SCSI Primary Commands - 2 (SPC-2)</I> specification. </DD>

<DT><B>TransferDisable</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates, when set to one, that the target supports the SCSI CONTINUE TASK and TARGET TRANSFER DISABLE messages.

<DT><B>LinkedCommands</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates, when set to one, that the operating system supports linked commands. A value of zero indicates the operating system does not support linked commands. </DD>

<DT><B>Synchronous</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates, when set to one, that the target supports synchronous data transfer. A value of zero indicates that the target does not support synchronous data transfer. </DD>

<DT><B>Wide16Bit</B></DT>

<DD>Contains eight bytes of ASCII data that identifies the vendor of the product.</DD>

<DT><B>ProductId</B></DT>

<DD>Contains sixteen bytes of ASCII data that indicates the product ID, as defined by the vendor. The data shall be left-aligned within this field and the unused bytes filled with ASCII blanks.</DD>

<DT><B>ProductRevisionLevel</B></DT>

<DD>Contains four bytes of ASCII data that indicates the product revision level, as defined by the vendor. </DD>

<DT><B>VendorSpecific</B></DT>
