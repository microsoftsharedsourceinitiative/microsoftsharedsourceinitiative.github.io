<P>There are three key differences between the implementation of the changer class/miniclass driver pair in Windows&nbsp;XP and in Windows&nbsp;2000:

<OL>
	<LI>Different use of a <A HREF="k305_5yr6.htm"><B>DriverEntry</B></A>  routine in the miniclass driver.
<P>In Windows&nbsp;2000, the changer class driver's <B>DriverEntry</B> routine performs various driver initialization tasks, including the initialization of entry points for I/O requests. In Windows&nbsp;XP and later operating systems, initialization takes place in the <B>DriverEntry</B> routine of the miniclass driver. See <A HREF="05chgr_4bvr.htm">Required Changer Miniclass Routines</A> for further information on the tasks that a miniclass driver's <B>DriverEntry</B> routine is required to perform. 
</LI>

	<LI>Different means of accessing <I>classpnp.sys </I>library routines.
<P>Class drivers for disk, tape, CD-ROM, and changer devices make use of the <I>classpnp.sys </I>library, a system-supplied DLL that contains a collection of operating system-specific, device-independent routines.

<P>Most system-supplied storage class drivers provide a set of key routines similar to routines found in the <I>classpnp.sys </I>library. This is done so that their miniclass drivers can call class driver routines instead of making direct calls to <I>classpnp.sys. </I>This shields the miniclass drivers from changes to the <I>classpnp.sys </I>DDI. 

<P>Windows&nbsp;2000 changer miniclass drivers are an exception to this rule, because in Windows&nbsp;2000 the changer class driver does not provide miniclass drivers with a facility for calling the <I>classpnp.sys </I>routines indirectly. Thus, in Windows&nbsp;2000, changer miniclass drivers must either call the <I>classpnp.sys </I>routines directly or call equivalent routines in line. Miniclass drivers that call <I>classpnp.sys </I>routines directly must link to the <I>classpnp.sys</I> library statically, swelling the size of the driver. If a driver dynamically links to <I>classpnp.sys</I>, changes to this library in subsequent releases might cause the driver to malfunction.

<P>In Windows&nbsp;XP and later operating systems, several of the most important services formerly provided by direct calls to the <I>classpnp.sys </I>library are provided by the changer class driver. Therefore, in Windows&nbsp;XP and later operating systems, it is usually unnecessary for changer miniclass drivers to call <I>classpnp.sys </I>library routines directly. 
</LI>

	<LI>The Windows&nbsp;XP changer class driver provides routines not available in Windows&nbsp;2000. The discussion that follows examines this difference.</LI>
</OL>

<P>In Windows&nbsp;2000, the changer class driver provides the following routines for the miniclass driver to call:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="k305_862a.htm">ChangerClassAllocatePool</A> — allocates pool memory. </LI>

	<LI><A HREF="k305_0xte.htm">ChangerClassFreePool</A> — frees pool memory. </LI>

	<LI><A HREF="k305_6n5e.htm">ChangerClassDebugPrint</A> — prints debugging information. </LI>
</UL>

<P>In Windows&nbsp;XP and later operating systems, the changer class driver provides, two additional routines in addition to the routines previously listed.

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="k305_6e5u.htm">ChangerClassInitialize</A> — The changer miniclass driver calls <B>ChangerClassInitialize</B> from within its <B>DriverEntry</B> routine to initialize the driver. <B>ChangerClassInitialize</B> performs many tasks formerly performed by the Windows&nbsp;2000 changer class driver's <B>DriverEntry</B> routine. </LI>

	<LI><A HREF="k305_8coi.htm">ChangerClassSendSrbSynchronous</A> — initializes and synchronously sends an SRB to an indicated target device.</LI>
</UL>
