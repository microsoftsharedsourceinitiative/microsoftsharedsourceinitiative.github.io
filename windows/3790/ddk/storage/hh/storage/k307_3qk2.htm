<H4>Operation</H4>

<P>If the driver can prevent the media from being removed while the drive is in use, the driver disables or enables the mechanism that ejects media, thereby locking the drive. A caller must open the device with FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES to send this request. </P>

<P>Unlike <A HREF="k307_735e.htm">IOCTL_STORAGE_MEDIA_REMOVAL</A>, the driver tracks <A HREF="#ddk_ioctl_storage_ejection_control_kr">IOCTL_STORAGE_EJECTION_CONTROL</A> requests by caller and ignores unlock requests for which it has not received a lock request from the same caller, thereby preventing other callers from unlocking the drive.</P>

<P>A driver for a removable media device which can support this IOCTL must do the following:

<OL>
	<LI>Keep a lock count, tagged by caller, in the device object extension.</LI>

	<LI>Keep the lock count per physical device.  </LI>

	<LI>When called with this IOCTL, if the flag to prevent removing the media is set, increment the count; if the flag is clear and the driver has previously received a lock request from the same caller, decrement the count.</LI>

	<LI>Prevent removal of the media unless all lock counts are zero.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Input, output, and I/O status block values for IOCTL_STORAGE_EJECTION_CONTROL are identical to those for IOCTL_STORAGE_MEDIA_REMOVAL.</P>
