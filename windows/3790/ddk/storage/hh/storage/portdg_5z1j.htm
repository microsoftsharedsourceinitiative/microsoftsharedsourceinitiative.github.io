<P>The ScsiPort driver has complete access to a set of scatter/gather list structures that define the memory ranges and physical addresses of an SRB. However, miniport drivers that work with the ScsiPort driver do not. The ScsiPort I/O model forces a miniport driver to manually discover and build its own scatter/gather list through repeated calls to the <A HREF="k301_9m0i.htm"><B>ScsiPortGetPhysicalAddress</B></A> routine. </P>

<P>The Storport I/O model provides its miniport drivers with direct access to the system's scatter/gather list structure, reducing the number of calls that the miniport has to make to port driver support routines to build its private scatter/gather list.</P>

<P>The scatter/gather list that <A HREF="k301_9lbm.htm"><B>StorPortGetScatterGatherList</B></A> returns is valid only until the SRB is completed. </P>

<P>The miniport does not have to free the memory for the scatter/gather list that <B>StorPortGetScatterGatherList</B> returns.</P>

<P>The miniport should perform any necessary translation of the scatter/gather list supplied by Storport to a miniport driver-specific format in the miniport's <A HREF="k301_29iq.htm"><I>HwStorBuildIo</I></A> routine.</P>
