<P>Depending on the nature of its device, an SFD might be responsible for the following device-type-specific functionality: 

<UL>
	<LI>Translating data from or into a device-specific format before or after sending a transfer request to lower drivers if the device processes data in a nonstandard format </LI>

	<LI>Setting up IRPs with SRBs for port-driver-supported I/O control requests, for driver-defined I/O control requests, or for pass-through requests, as necessary for its device, and sending those IRPs to the next-lower driver</LI>

	<LI>Modifying class driver-supplied SRBs as necessary for its device</LI>

	<LI>Establishing time-out values for requests </LI>

	<LI>Supplying one or more <I>IoCompletion</I> routines and, like the corresponding storage class driver, handling certain error conditions and retries for device-specific requests that require special handling </LI>
</UL>

<P>In general, an SFD has the same responsibilities as a storage class driver for those requests that require device-specific handling. For a discussion of the functionality required of storage class drivers, see <A HREF="03class_1k13.htm">Storage Class Drivers</A>. </P>
