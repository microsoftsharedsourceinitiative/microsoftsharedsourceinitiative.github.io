<H4>Operation</H4>

<P>This IOCTL checks to see if the given volume has a drive letter. If it already has a drive letter, or if the volume has a special Mount Manager database entry indicating that it does not require a drive letter, this routine returns the current drive letter (if there is one) and does nothing. If the given volume does not have a drive letter and does not have a special Mount Manager database entry indicating that it does not require a drive letter, the next available drive letter is assigned to the volume. If the volume's nonpersistent device name begins with "\Device\Floppy", the Mount Manager will check for available drive letters starting with the letter "A." If the volume name begins with "\Device\CdRom" the Mount Manager will check for available drive letters starting with drive letter "D." In all other cases, the Mount Manager starts with drive letter "C." </P>

<H4>Input</H4>

<P><B>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</B> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the input buffer, which must be greater than or equal to <B>sizeof</B>(MOUNTMGR_DRIVE_LETTER_TARGET).</P>

<P><B>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OuputBufferLength</B> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the output buffer, which must be greater than or equal to <B>sizeof</B>(MOUNTMGR_DRIVE_LETTER_INFORMATION).</P>

<P>The Mount Manager client initializes the <A HREF="k306_0joy.htm">MOUNTMGR_DRIVE_LETTER_TARGET</A> structure, defined in <I>mountmgr.h</I>, at the beginning of the buffer at <B>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</B>. The client must insert the name of the target volume at the address pointed to by the <I>DeviceName[]</I> member of this structure. The target volume name is the name of the nonpersistent device object associated with the volume (for example, "\Device\HarddiskVolume1"). </P>

<H4>Output</H4>

<P>The Mount Manager inserts either the current drive letter or the newly assigned drive letter (see previous discussion) in the <A HREF="k306_4u2a.htm">MOUNTMGR_DRIVE_LETTER_INFORMATION</A> structure, defined in <I>mountmgr.h</I>, at the beginning of the buffer at <B>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</B>.</P>

<H4>I/O Status Block</H4>

<P>If the operation is successful , the <B>Status</B> field is set to STATUS_SUCCESS.</P>

<P>If <B>InputBufferLength</B> is less than <B>sizeof</B>(MOUNTMGR_DRIVE_LETTER_TARGET) or if <B>OutputBufferLength</B> is less than <B>sizeof</B>(MOUNTMGR_DRIVE_LETTER_INFORMATION), the <B>Status</B> field is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.</P>

<H4>Headers</H4>
