<P>Kbdclass and Mouclass can support more than one device in two different modes. In the <I>one-to-one mode</I>, each device has an independent device stack. The class driver creates and attaches an independent class DO to each device stack. Each device stack has its own control state and input buffer. The Microsoft® Win32® subsystem accesses input from each device through a unique file object.</P>

<P>In the <I>grandmaster mode</I>, the class driver operates all the devices in the following way:

<UL>
	<LI>The class driver creates both a <I>grandmaster class DO</I> that represents all of the devices and a <I>subordinate class DO</I> for each device.
<P>The class driver attaches a subordinate class DO to each device stack. Below the subordinate class DO, the device stack is same as that created in the one-to-one mode.
</LI>

	<LI>The grandmaster class DO controls the operation of all the subordinate DOs.</LI>

	<LI>The Win32 subsystem accesses all device input through the file object that represents the grandmaster class device.</LI>

	<LI>All device input is buffered in the grandmaster's data queue. </LI>

	<LI>The grandmaster maintains a single global device state.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Kbdclass and Mouclass operate in the one-to-one mode if their registry entry value <B>ConnectMultiplePorts</B> is set to 0x00 (under the key <B>HKLM\Services\CurrentControlSet\</B><I>&lt;class service&gt;\</I><B>Parameters</B>, where <I>class service</I> is Kbdclass or Mouclass). Otherwise Kbdclass and Mouclass operate in grandmaster mode.</P>
