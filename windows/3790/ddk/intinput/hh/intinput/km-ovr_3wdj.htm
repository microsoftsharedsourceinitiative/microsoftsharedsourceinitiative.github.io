<P>This topic describes the typical physical configuration of keyboard and mouse devices in Microsoft® Windows® 2000 and later.</P>

<P>The following figures show two common configurations that employ a single keyboard and a single mouse.</P>

<P><B>Right Figure: Keyboard and Mouse devices Connected Through an Integrated Controller</B></P>

<P>The figure on the left shows a keyboard and a mouse connected to a system bus through independent controllers. A typical configuration consists of a PS/2-style keyboard operated through an i8042 controller, and a serial-style mouse operated through a serial port controller. The figure on the right shows the keyboard and mouse connected through an integrated keyboard and mouse controller. A typical configuration consists of a PS/2-style keyboard and a PS/2-style mouse operated through an i8042 controller.</P>

<P>Windows also supports the simultaneous connection of more than one keyboard and mouse device. However, Windows does not support independent access by a client to each device. The Microsoft Win32® subsystem opens all keyboard and mouse devices for its exclusive use.</P>
