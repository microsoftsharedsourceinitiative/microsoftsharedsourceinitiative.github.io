<P>To customize the operation of a device, a filter driver needs to write control data to the device. The filter driver must synchronize writes to a device with the device's interrupt service routine and other asynchronous reads or writes on the device (for example, writes that are initiated by a set typematic request or a set keyboard indicator request).</P>

<P>I8042prt supports an <A HREF="i8042ref_0vci.htm">IOCTL_INTERNAL_I8042_KEYBOARD_WRITE_BUFFER</A> request and an <A HREF="i8042ref_5hgy.htm">IOCTL_INTERNAL_I8042_MOUSE_WRITE_BUFFER</A> request for this purpose. A write buffer request is synchronized with the device's ISR and other requests that read or write the device.</P>
