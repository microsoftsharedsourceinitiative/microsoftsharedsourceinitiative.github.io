<P>The Microsoft® Win32® subsystem opens all keyboard and mouse devices for its exclusive use. For each device class, the Win32 subsystem treats input from all the devices as if the input came from a single input device. An application cannot request to receive input from only one particular device.</P>

<P>The Win32 subsystem dynamically opens Plug and Play input devices after it receives notification from the Plug and Play Manager that a GUID_CLASS_KEYBOARD or GUID_CLASS_MOUSE device interface is enabled. The Win32 subsystem closes Plug and Play devices after it receives notification that an opened interface is disabled. The Win32 subsystem also opens legacy devices by name (for example, "\Device\KeyboardLegacyClass0"). Note that once the Win32 subsystem successfully opens a legacy device, it cannot determine if the device is later physically removed.</P>

<P>After Kbdclass and Mouclass receive a create request they do the following for Plug and Play and legacy operation:

<UL>
	<LI><B>Plug and Play Operation</B>
<P>If the device is in the Plug and Play started state, the class driver sends the IRP_MJ_CREATE request down the driver stack. Otherwise the class driver completes the request without sending the request down the driver stack. The class driver sets the trusted file that has read access to the device. If there is a grandmaster device, the class driver sends a create request to all the ports that are associated with the subordinate class devices.

<P>For information about grandmaster devices, see <A HREF="km-ovr_6muf.htm">Configuration of Device Objects for More Than One Device</A>.
</LI>

	<LI><B>Legacy Operation</B>
<P>The class driver sends an internal device control request to the port driver to enable the device.
