<P>The basic architecture of the DirectInput control panel consists of the DirectInput game controller control panel, the abstraction-layer library that supports the <B>IDIGameCntrlPropSheet</B> COM interface, and a COM object for each game controller property sheet. </P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "object" describes an entity created by <B>CreateInstance</B> to support the methods of a COM interface, even when these methods are not being called through an object-oriented programming language such as C++. The word "sheet" describes the dialog into which the pages insert. The word "page" describes the content dialogs of the "property sheet" dialog. </P>

<P>In the interest of portability between Microsoft Windows®&nbsp;95/98/Me and Windows&nbsp;NT®&nbsp;4.0 and later, the DirectInput control panel works directly with DirectInput, which in turn works directly with device drivers. As a by-product of this, the DirectInput control panel has access to input devices even when the application is in the background. </P>
