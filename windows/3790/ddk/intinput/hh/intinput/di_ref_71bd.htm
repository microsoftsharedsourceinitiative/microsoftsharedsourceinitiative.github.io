<H4>Members</H4>

<DL>
<DT><B>dwEffectId</B> </DT>

<DD>Specifies an arbitrary 32-bit value that is passed to the driver to identify the effect. The driver receives this value as the <I>dwEffectID</I> parameter to the <A HREF="di_ref_28h5.htm"><B>IDirectInputEffectDriver::DownloadEffect</B></A> method. </DD>

<DT><B>dwEffType</B> </DT>

<DD>Describes the category and capabilities of the effect. This member must consist of exactly one of the following values: 

<DL>
<DT>DIEFT_CONSTANTFORCE </DT>

<DD>The effect represents a constant force effect. When creating or modifying a constant force effect, the <B>lpvTypeSpecificParams</B> member of the DIEFFECT structure points to a DICONSTANTFORCE structure and the <B>cbTypeSpecificParams</B> member of the DIEFFECT structure is set to <B>sizeof</B>(DICONSTANTFORCE<CODE>)</CODE>. </DD>

<DT>DIEFT_RAMPFORCE </DT>

<DD>The effect represents a ramp-force effect. When creating or modifying a ramp-force effect, the <B>lpvTypeSpecificParams</B> member of the DIEFFECT structure points to a DIRAMPFORCE structure and the <B>cbTypeSpecificParams</B> member of the DIEFFECT structure is set to <B>sizeof</B>(DIRAMPFORCE<CODE>)</CODE>. </DD>

<DT>DIEFT_PERIODIC </DT>

<DD>The effect represents a periodic effect. When creating or modifying a periodic effect, the <B>lpvTypeSpecificParams</B> member of the DIEFFECT structure points to a DIPERIODIC structure and the <B>cbTypeSpecificParams</B> member of the DIEFFECT structure is set to <B>sizeof</B>(DIPERIODIC<CODE>)</CODE>. </DD>

<DT>DIEFT_CONDITION </DT>

<DD>The effect represents a condition. When creating or modifying a condition, the <B>lpvTypeSpecificParams</B> member of the DIEFFECT structure points to an array of DICONDITION structures (either exactly one DICONDITION structure or one DICONDITION structure per axis) and the <B>cbTypeSpecificParams</B> member of the DIEFFECT structure is set to <B>sizeof</B>(DICONDITION<CODE>)</CODE> or cAxis *<CODE> </CODE><B>sizeof</B>(DICONDITION<CODE>)</CODE>, respectively. If <B>cbTypeSpecificParams</B> is set to <B>sizeof</B>(DICONDITION<CODE>)</CODE>, then the effect represents a single-axis condition that may be rotated. If <B>cbTypeSpecificParams</B> is set to cAxis * <B>sizeof</B>(DICONDITION<CODE>)</CODE>, then the effect represents a multiple-axis condition, with each DICONDITION structure applying to the respective axis in the <B>rgdwAxes</B> list. </DD>

<DT>DIEFT_CUSTOMFORCE </DT>

<DD>The effect represents a custom force effect. When creating or modifying a custom force effect, the <B>lpvTypeSpecificParams</B> member of the DIEFFECT structure points to a DICUSTOMFORCE structure and the <B>cbTypeSpecificParams</B> member of the DIEFFECT structure is set to <B>sizeof</B>(DICUSTOMFORCE<CODE>)</CODE>. </DD>

<DT>DIEFT_HARDWARE </DT>

<DD>The effect represents a hardware-specific effect. The hardware vendor is required to provide additional documentation to the application writer on how the effect should be used. 

<P>In addition to the category code, this member can also contain zero, one, or more of the following flags that describe the effect's capabilities: 
</DD>

<DT>DIEFT_FFATTACK </DT>

<DD>The effect generator for this effect supports the attack envelope parameter. If the effect generator does not support attack, then the attack level and attack time parameters of the DIENVELOPE structure are ignored by the effect. </DD>

<DT>DIEFT_FFFADE </DT>

<DD>The effect generator for this effect supports the fade parameter. If the effect generator does not support fade, the fade level and fade time parameters of the DIENVELOPE structure are ignored by the effect. If DIEFT_FFATTACK or DIEFT_FFFADE is not set, then the effect does not support an envelope, and any provided envelope is ignored. </DD>

<DT>DIEFT_SATURATION </DT>

<DD>The effect generator for this effect supports the saturation of condition effects. If the effect generator does not support saturation, then the force generated by a condition is limited only by the maximum force that the device can generate. </DD>

<DT>DIEFT_POSNEGCOEFFICIENTS </DT>

<DD>The effect generator for this effect supports two coefficient values for conditions, one for the positive displacement of the axis and one for the negative displacement of the axis. If the device does not support both coefficients, then the negative coefficient in the DICONDITION structure is ignored and the positive coefficient is used in both directions. </DD>

<DT>DIEFT_POSNEGSATURATION </DT>

<DD>The effect generator for the effect supports a maximum saturation for both positive and negative force output. If the device does not support both saturation values, then the negative saturation in the DICONDITION structure is ignored and the positive saturation is used in both directions. </DD>
</DL>
</DD>

<DT><B>dwStaticParams</B> </DT>

<DD>Describes the parameters supported by the effect. For example, if DIEP_ENVELOPE is set, then the effect supports an envelope. All effects should support at least DIEP_DURATION, DIEP_AXES, and DIEP_TYPESPECIFICPARAMS. It is not an error for an application to attempt to use effect parameters that are not supported by the device. The unsupported parameters are merely ignored. This value can be zero, one, or more of the following flags: 

<DL>
<DT>DIEP_DURATION </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the driver supports changing the <B>dwDuration</B> (see the DIEFFECT structure) of an effect when the effect is not playing. </DD>

<DT>DIEP_SAMPLEPERIOD </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the driver supports changing the <B>dwSamplePeriod</B> (see the DIEFFECT structure) of an effect when the effect is not playing. </DD>

<DT>DIEP_GAIN </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the driver supports changing the <B>dwGain</B> (see the DIEFFECT structure) of an effect when the effect is not playing. </DD>

<DT>DIEP_TRIGGERBUTTON </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the driver supports changing the <B>dwTriggerButton</B> (see the DIEFFECT structure) of an effect when the effect is not playing. </DD>

<DT>DIEP_TRIGGERREPEATINTERVAL </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the driver supports changing the <B>dwTriggerRepeatInterval</B> (see the DIEFFECT structure) of an effect when the effect is not playing. </DD>

<DT>DIEP_AXES </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the driver supports changing the <B>cAxes</B> and <B>rgdwAxes</B> (see the DIEFFECT structure) of an effect when the effect is not playing. </DD>

<DT>DIEP_DIRECTION </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the driver supports changing the <B>cAxes</B> and <B>rglDirection</B> (see the DIEFFECT structure) of an effect when the effect is not playing. (The <B>dwFlags</B> member of the DIEFFECT structure specifies, through DIEFF_CARTESIAN or DIEFF_POLAR, the coordinate system in which the values should be interpreted.) </DD>

<DT>DIEP_ENVELOPE </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the driver supports changing the <B>lpEnvelope</B> (see the DIEFFECT structure) of an effect when the effect is not playing. </DD>

<DT>DIEP_TYPESPECIFICPARAMS </DT>

<DD>Indicates that the driver supports changing the <B>cbTypeSpecificParams</B> and <B>lpTypeSpecificParams</B> (see the DIEFFECT structure) of an effect when the effect is not playing. Note that the buffer pointed to by the <B>lpTypeSpecificParams</B> member of the DIEFFECT structure must remain valid for the lifetime of the effect (or until the type-specific parameter is set to a new value). DirectInput does not make a private copy of the buffer. </DD>
</DL>
</DD>

<DT><B>dwDynamicParams</B> </DT>

<DD>Describes the parameters of the effect that can be modified while the effect is playing. If an application attempts to change a parameter while the effect is playing, and the driver does not support modifying that effect dynamically, then the driver shall return DIERR_EFFECTPLAYING. This member uses the same flags as the <B>dwStaticParams</B> member, except that the flags are interpreted as describing whether the driver can modify the parameters of an effect while the effect is playing, rather than while it is not playing. </DD>

<DT><B>dwCoords</B> </DT>

<DD>One or more coordinate system flags (DIEFF_CARTESIAN, DIEFF_POLAR, DIEFF_SPHERICAL) indicating which coordinate systems are supported by the effect. At least one coordinate system must be supported. If an application attempts to set a direction in an unsupported coordinate system, DirectInput automatically converts it to a coordinate system that the device does support. 
</DD>
