<H4>Parameters</H4>

<DL>
<DT><I>dwDeviceID</I> </DT>

<DD>Indicates the joystick ID number being used. </DD>

<DT><I>lpdwMask</I> </DT>

<DD>Points to a <B>DWORD</B> mask that describes the data requested on entry, and the data returned on exit. The mask is a combination of the following:

<DD>Bitmask for the <B>dwZ</B> member of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_R </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the <B>dwR</B> member of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DD>Bitmask for the <B>dwV</B> member of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_POV0 </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the <B>dwPOV0</B> member of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_POV1 </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the <B>dwPOV1</B> member of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DD>Bitmask for the <B>dwPOV2</B> member of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_POV3 </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the <B>dwPOV3</B> member of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_BTN0 </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the <B>dwBTN0</B> member of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_BTN1 </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the <B>dwBTN1</B> member of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_BTN2 </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the <B>dwBTN2</B> member of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_BTN3 </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the <B>dwBTN3</B> member of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_RESERVED0 </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the <B>dwReserved0</B> member of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_RESERVED1 </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the <B>dwReserved1</B> member of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_ELEMENT_MASK </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for all members of the VJPOLLDATA structure. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_POSITION </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the position attribute of the device. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_VELOCITY </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the velocity attribute of the device. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_ACCELERATION </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the acceleration attribute of the device. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_FORCE </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for the force attribute of the device. </DD>

<DT>JOYPD_ATTRIB_MASK </DT>

<DD>Bitmask for all possible attributes of the device. </DD>
</DL>
</DD>

<DT><I>lpPollData</I> </DT>

<DD>Points to the polling data. 
</DD>
</DL>

<H4>Return Value</H4>

<P>Returns S_OK if the poll was completed successfully, returns S_FALSE if returned data is (partially or wholly) out of date; otherwise returns an error value. </P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>The upper and lower words of the <I>lpdwMask</I> parameter are treated separately. The lower word is a simple bitmask of the elements in the <A HREF="di_ref_463t.htm">VJPOLLDATA</A> structure. The upper word describes the attributes for which these elements are requested. The <I>lpPollData</I> parameter to the poll contains an array of at least as many VJPOLLDATA structures as there are bits set in the upper word of the mask. </P>

<P>The first VJPOLLDATA structure should contain the position information. The next three VJPOLLDATA structures should contain information about the acceleration, velocity, and force, in that order. For example, if the device only supports position and force, the first structure will contain position data, the second and third structures are empty and therefore skipped, and the fourth structure will contain force information. </P>

<P>The minidriver should always set the mask to what it can return, even if the poll fails because the device is unplugged. So if the device has less than 33 buttons, X, Y and R, for position only, it should perform an operation such as *pdwMask &amp;= ( JOYPD_POSITION | JOYPD_BTN0 | JOYPD_X | JOYPD_Y | JOYPD_R ); before searching for the available data. </P>

<P>If the device can return data for more than one attribute, the upper word has a bit set for each attribute and the lower word should have the bit set for any element that can be returned for any of the supported attributes. So even though force is an unlikely value for the button masks (which are single bit), if the device reports buttons in the position data and force for X and Y, then position, force, X, Y and buttons should all have their bits set. </P>
