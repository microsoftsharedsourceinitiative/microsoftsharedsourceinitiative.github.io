<DT><A NAME="ddk_miniport_driver_kg_gly"></A><B>miniport driver</B></DT>

<DD>A device type-specific kernel-mode driver, usually implemented as a dynamic-link library, that provides an interface between a port driver and the system's hardware. Windows operating systems define the architecture of the following kinds of miniport drivers:</DD>
</DL>



<OL>
	<LI>An HBA-specific driver, linked against the system-supplied SCSI port driver, that drives one or more SCSI buses, or a mass-storage device driver that uses the NT SCSI port driver as its interface to the system.</LI>

	<LI>A video-adapter-specific driver, linked against the system-supplied video port driver, that supports a corresponding display driver.</LI>

	<LI>A network-adapter-specific driver, linked against the system-supplied NDIS library.</LI>
</OL>



<DL>
<DT><A NAME="ddk_mirror_driver_kg_gly"></A><B>mirror driver</B></DT>
</DL>

<OL>
	<LI>A <I>shadow driver</I> or <I>RAID1 driver</I>.
<P>An intermediate (layered somewhere between an FS and a disk DD) driver whose responsibility is to maintain a duplicate of a disk partition.

<P>The system-supplied fault-tolerant disk driver, ftdisk, is a mirror driver.
</LI>

	<LI>A display driver for a virtual device that mirrors the drawing operations of one or more additional physical display devices.
<P>When video mirroring is active, each time the system draws to the primary video device at a location inside the mirrored area, a copy of the draw operation is executed on the mirrored video device in real time. With this mirroring scheme, you can simultaneously draw the same output to several video devices. Since the driver allocates memory dynamically for targets, the number of displays that your system can support depends on how much free memory you have at mirror time. 
</LI>
</OL>



<DL>
<DT><A NAME="ddk_monitor_profile_gg_gly"></A><B>monitor profile</B></DT>

<DD>A type of device profile used for color management. This profile contains information about how to convert colors in a monitor's <I>color space</I> and <I>color gamut</I> into colors in a device-independent color space. Any user-mode application, such as a setup program or a word processor with graphics capabilities, can use a monitor profile, provided that Image Color Management (ICM) has been enabled, and that the application has knowledge of the profile's format.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_monolithic_driver_kg_gly"></A><B>monolithic driver</B></DT>

<DD>A driver that does not consist of a class/miniclass or port/miniport driver pair.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_motion_vector_arithmetic_kg_gly"></A><B>motion vector arithmetic</B></DT>

<DD>In DirectX® video acceleration, operations that convert motion vectors to prediction block addresses.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_mount_kg_gly"></A><B>mount</B></DT>

<DD>Operation that requests a file system to make a volume useable by the I/O Manager. This is done by filling in the information in a VPB to indicate the serial number and label of the volume, as well as by filling in the pointer to the file system’s device object that represents the "volume" mounted on the real device.

<DT><A NAME="_mtd_glossary"></A><B>MTD</B></DT>

<DD>Memory technology driver. A protected-mode driver that works with Windows&nbsp;95 protected-mode PC Card software to enable form-factor cards, such as flash memory cards. Such memory cards and their related drivers do not provide full Plug and Play capabilities.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_multifunction_device_ks"></A><B>multifunction device</B></DT>

<DD>A piece of hardware that supports multiple discrete capabilities, such as audio, mixer, and music, on a single card. This device is sometimes treated as a bus that can be enumerated to locate the devices on that bus.

</DD>

<DT><A NAME="ddk_multiprocessor_machine_kg_gly"></A><B>multiprocessor machine</B></DT>

<DD>A platform with more than one CPU. The NT-based operating system is designed to run on multiprocessor machines, usually configured to be:

<UL>
	<LI><I>Homogenous</I> – all CPUs are identical, and either all have identical coprocessors or none has a coprocessor.</LI>

	<LI><I>Closely coupled</I> – all CPUs share memory and have uniform access to memory.</LI>

	<LI><I>Symmetric</I>– every CPU can access memory, handle any interrupt, and access I/O control registers just like every other CPU in the system. Note that any version of Windows that runs on a symmetric multiprocessor machine also runs <I>unchanged</I> on a uniprocessor machine based on the same CPU.</LI>
</UL>


<P>While Windows can run on <I>asymmetric</I> platforms, configured with a master CPU that handles all IRQs and one or more slave CPUs as long as the platform is both homogenous and closely coupled, the system has been designed to run primarily on symmetric multiprocessor platforms because SMP machines have better performance characteristics, particularly for I/O.

<DT><A NAME="ddk_music_class_ks"></A><B>music class</B></DT>

<DD>The class of filters that deal with music data, such as MIDI.</DD>
