<P>Microsoft provides a complete integrated drive electronics (IDE) driver stack that is capable of driving most IDE controllers. There are three system-supplied IDE drivers in the IDE driver stack: <I>atapi.sys</I> (port driver), <I>pciidex.sys</I> (controller driver), and <I>pciide.sys</I> (generic controller minidriver). All three drivers are described in the figure that follows.</P>

<P>Note that the driver model for IDE devices changed in Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;2000. In Microsoft Windows NT® 4.0, the port driver, <I>atapi.sys</I>, was a SCSI miniport driver that linked to <I>scsiport.sys</I>. In Windows&nbsp;2000 and later operating systems, the IDE port driver <I>atapi.sys </I>became an independent driver that no longer links to <I>scsiport.sys</I>, nor to any other wrapper driver. In the IDE driver model for Windows&nbsp;2000 and later operating systems, the controller driver that is below the port driver in the driver stack is split into a controller driver and a controller minidriver. See the description of these drivers that accompanies the following figure. </P>

<P>The following figure illustrates the IDE driver stack.  </P>

<OL>
	<LI>The IDE stack in Windows&nbsp;2000 and later is layered over the PCI bus driver. </LI>

	<LI>Microsoft provides a native IDE controller driver/minidriver pair that is capable of driving most IDE controllers. The IDE controller driver, <I>pciidex.sys</I>, handles the hardware-independent aspects of the driver pair, and the minidriver, <I>pciide.sys</I>, handles the hardware-dependent aspects. </LI>

	<LI>Vendors can elect to provide their own IDE controller minidriver instead of using the native minidriver, <I>pciide.sys</I>. Vendor-supplied minidrivers handle the hardware-specific aspects of the vendor's minidriver. The vendor's minidriver must work together with the Microsoft-supplied controller driver to form a controller-minidriver pair. See <A HREF="ide_minikg_36zr.htm">Requirements for Vendor-Supplied IDE Controller Minidrivers</A> for an explanation of the requirements a vendor's minidriver must fulfill to work properly with the native Microsoft controller driver. </LI>

	<LI>Microsoft provides an IDE port driver, <I>atapi.sys</I> (also known as the <I>channel driver</I>, because it creates and manages a functional device object (FDO) for each IDE channel). The port driver is layered above the IDE controller/minidriver pair. It translates the SCSI request blocks (SRB) that it receives from the storage class driver into the format required by the underlying IDE controller. In particular, the command descriptor blocks<I> </I>(CDB) contained within an SRB are defined differently for ATAPI and SCSI devices. The port driver repackages CDBs to make them compatible with the ATAPI transport protocol, thereby insulating upper level drivers from peculiarities of the IDE bus. </LI>

	<LI>Microsoft provides a CD-ROM class driver capable of driving all CD-ROM (type 5 SCSI) devices.</LI>
