<P>This section describes Microsoft® Windows® requirements for vendor-supplied IDE controller minidrivers.</P>

<P>The Microsoft-supplied IDE port driver, <I>atapi.sys</I>, and controller driver, <I>pciidex.sys</I>, are hardware-independent and can be used with almost all IDE controllers. Thus, vendor-supplied port drivers and controller drivers are not required.</P>

<P>Microsoft also supplies a native controller minidriver, <I>pciide.sys</I>, which handles the hardware-dependent aspects of the controller driver-minidriver pair and which can be used with most IDE controller hardware. Vendors can elect to supply their own controller minidriver instead of using <I>pciide.sys</I>. </P>

<P>A vendor-supplied controller minidriver does not need to support Plug and Play (PnP) or power management. PnP and power management operations are handled by the Microsoft-supplied controller driver, <I>pciidex.sys</I>. </P>

<P>A vendor-supplied controller minidriver does not need to register any particular interface in order to comply with system requirements. </P>

<P>A vendor-supplied controller minidriver should not attempt to access the registry, nor should it call kernel-mode routines other than those provided by the PciIdeX library.</P>

<P>A vendor-supplied controller minidriver must provide a set of standard minidriver routines that permit the system-supplied controller driver to do hardware-dependent operations transparently. </P>

<P>For more information on the PciIdeX library and a description of the minidriver routine interface between the system-supplied controller driver and a vendor-supplied controller minidriver, see <A HREF="ide_minikg_8jea.htm">Initializing and Calling IDE Minidriver Routines</A>. </P>
