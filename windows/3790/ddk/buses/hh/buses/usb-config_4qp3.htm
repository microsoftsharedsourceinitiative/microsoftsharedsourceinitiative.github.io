<P>Many hardware vendors are designing USB devices that make use of firmware as an alternative to developing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Firmware also facilitates testing and upgrades, and in theory, the operation of firmware is strictly internal to the device, and therefore, operating system independent. However, in practice, firmware downloads can cause operating system errors if certain precautions are not taken.</P>

<P>If you have a USB device that downloads a firmware image, you should do the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Ensure that the device has two separate sets of vendor, device and revision IDs. Devices that must download firmware are enumerated twice. The first time the system detects the device, it loads a preliminary driver that downloads the firmware. Once the firmware is loaded, the preliminary driver does a bus reset, causing the system to enumerate the device a second time. After the second enumeration the system loads the principal device driver for the device. The firmware must provide a second, different set of vendor, device and revision IDs on the second enumeration, so that the system can clearly determine when to load the preliminary driver and when to load the principal device driver. </LI>

	<LI>Ensure that the vendor, device and revision IDs are unique and specific to your product. If your device includes a programmable USB chip purchased from a third party, the chip might identify itself using a standard set of IDs. If the same chip is used with another hardware device on the same system, there might be contention between the two devices for the same set of IDs, and this will cause the operating system to malfunction.</LI>
</UL>

<P>You should also be aware that the use of firmware can produce the following problems:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>In Windows XP, attaching your device to the system might cause multiple plug and unplug sounds. This might confuse the end user.</LI>

	<LI>Since firmware has to be downloaded every time the device starts up, the device may not be functional immediately after it has been plugged in, nor immediately after the operating system resumes from an S3 or S4 state. </LI>

	<LI>On a resume from S3 or S4, your device might cause the surprise removal dialog box to pop up, because most machines cut off power to self powered devices in S4 mode.</LI>
</UL>
