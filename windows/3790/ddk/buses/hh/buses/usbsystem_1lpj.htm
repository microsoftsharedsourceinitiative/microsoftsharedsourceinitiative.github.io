<P>The following figure illustrates a WDM device object stack created in Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;2000. This stack is generated for a composite USB device containing both a keyboard interface and a power keys interface.</P>

<P>Starting from the bottom of the figure, the following describes each device object or device object stack and its associated driver: 

<OL>
	<LI>The PCI bus driver enumerates the USB host controllers in the system and creates a PDO for each one. Windows&nbsp;2000 supports only USB&nbsp;1.1-compliant host controller hardware. The system loads the host controller class/miniclass driver pair, <I>usbd.sys</I>, and either <I>uhcd.sys </I>or <I>openhci.sys</I>. The host controller driver pair then creates an FDO for the host controller. </LI>

	<LI>The host controller class/miniclass driver pair enumerates the root USB hub. The <I>usbhub.sys </I>driver enumerates all other USB hubs, creating both a PDO and an FDO for each hub. The figure shows only one level of hub device objects, but USB allows the daisy-chaining of hub devices, so there could potentially be many more hub device objects in the tree. In this example, the hub driver detects and enumerates the USB composite keyboard device and creates a PDO for it. </LI>

	<LI>In Windows&nbsp;2000, a generic parent facility is provided with the USB bus (or hub) driver. The hub driver detects that the device is a composite device. After creating a PDO for the device as a whole, the hub driver creates an FDO for the entire composite device. The FDO serves as a base upon which the hub driver can create separate PDOs for each interface of the device. In Windows&nbsp;XP and later operating systems, as well as in Windows&nbsp;Me and later operating systems, these actions are performed by a separate generic parent driver. For more information, see <A HREF="usbsystem_67xj.htm">USB Device Stack for Windows XP and Later</A>. </LI>

	<LI>In the example illustrated in the figure, the composite device consists of a HID-compliant keyboard interface and a HID-compliant power keys interface. The hub driver creates a separate PDO for each interface. Then the HID class driver creates an FDO for each interface. </LI>
