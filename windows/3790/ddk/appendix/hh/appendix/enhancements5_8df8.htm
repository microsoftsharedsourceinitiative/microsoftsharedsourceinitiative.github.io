<P>Windows&nbsp;XP introduces hot-add memory support, which will allow memory devices to be added to a machine and be made available to the operating system and applications as part of the normal memory pool — without turning the machine off or rebooting. </P>

<P>Hot-add memory support will be especially appreciated by enterprise system administrators who need to add memory resources to keep up with production demands, but are working with systems that require continuous (24x7) availability. This action would typically require shutting down the system and interrupting service. With the hot-add feature, service performance can be increased without service interruption.</P>

<P>Removal of memory regions will not be supported in Windows&nbsp;XP. A memory upgrade, which requires removing and then adding memory, will also not be supported in Windows&nbsp;XP. </P>

<P>Memory mirroring (different from hot-add) is also introduced in Windows XP, providing increased availability for extremely high-end systems (for example, Stratus, and so on).</P>

<P class=note><B>Caution</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This feature will operate only on servers that have hardware support for adding memory while the server is operating. Most existing servers do not have this type of hardware support and could be damaged if memory is installed while the power is on. Consult the server operator's manual for more information. A small number of new servers will offer the ability to add memory while the server is operating. For these servers, the act of installing memory will automatically invoke the hot-add memory feature in the operating system.</P>
