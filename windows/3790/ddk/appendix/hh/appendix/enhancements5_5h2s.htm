<P>Windows&nbsp;XP supports the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI), a new standard for the interface provided by the firmware that boots PCs. Microsoft will support EFI as the only firmware interface to boot the 64-bit version of Windows for Itanium-based systems. Because the 64-bit version of Windows will not boot with BIOS or with the system abstraction layer (SAL) alone, EFI is a requirement for all Itanium-based systems to boot Windows.</P>

<P>Windows&nbsp;XP also supports the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT), which was introduced as part of the EFI initiative. GPT complements the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme that has been common to PCs. GPT allows use of very large disks. The number of partitions on a GPT disk is not constrained by temporary schemes such as container partitions, as defined by the MBR Extended Boot Record (EBR).</P>

<P>The GPT disk partition format is well defined and fully self-identifying. Data critical to platform operation is located in partitions and not in unpartitioned or hidden sectors. GPT disks use primary and backup partition tables for redundancy and CRC32 fields for improved partition data structure integrity. The GPT partition format uses version number and size fields for future expansion. Each GPT partition has a GUID and a partition content type, so no coordination is necessary to prevent partition identifier collision. Each GPT partition has a 36-character Unicode name, which means that any software can present a human-readable name for the partition without any additional understanding of the partition.</P>
