<P>Beginning with Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT® 4.0, and continuing with Windows&nbsp;2000, Input Method Editors (IMEs) are provided as a dynamic-link library (DLL) for use in entering characters into foreign language applications, in contrast to the IMEs for the Windows 3.1 East Asian Edition. An IME for each language runs as one of the multilingual keyboard layouts. In comparison to the old Windows 3.1 IME, the new Win32 Multilingual Input Method Manager (IMM) and Input Method Editor (IME) architecture provide the following advantages:

<UL>
	<LI>Run as a component of the multilingual environment localization.</LI>

	<LI>Offer multiple input contexts for each application task.</LI>

	<LI>Keep one active IME per each application thread.</LI>

	<LI>Give information to the application through message looping (does not break apps message order).</LI>
</UL>

<P>As an example, to enter Japanese characters using a standard U.S. keyboard on a localized Japanese version of Windows&nbsp;2000, you must use an IME.</P>

<P>IME provides several different methods of entering Hiragana, Hurigana,Katakana, Kanji, and Romaji characters using IME, WX2, VJ2, and ATOK7. The IME input method is used by default. To change the default input method, run IME from the Program Manager "Nihon go jin ka" group.</P>

<P>To invoke IME, you must use the key combination ALT+~ or ALT+` to launch 4 applications (located in the lower right hand corner on your desktop). These applications provide several Japanese characters you can enter into your document. To disable IME, you must use the same key combination of ALT+ ~ or ALT+ ` again.</P>

<P>There are basically two groups of Windows NT 4.0: European versions of NT, and East Asian versions of NT. The European versions ( English, French, German, Russian, Polish, etc.) are almost identical to each other, and the only differences between the different versions of NT in this group are the resources in each dll and exe (if the dlls contain resources). The resources in each system dll or exe would, of course, be containing strings and dialogs in different versions. The main thing you need to pay attention to when you are testing IME in this group is to make sure that the font you have chosen to display text is a font that can display strings in a certain language; otherwise, European versions of NT are the same as the English version.</P>
