<P>Microsoft has made many enhancements to the kernel of the Microsoft® Windows® XP operating system. This section provides an overview of the new features and changes in the kernel for Windows&nbsp;XP and later versions, intended for system and peripheral designers, driver developers, and firmware developers who are creating products that run on Windows&nbsp;XP and later versions. </P>

<P>Kernel improvements are significant because the kernel provides low-level operating system functions, including thread scheduling, interrupt and exception dispatching, multiprocessor synchronization, and a set of routines and basic objects used by the rest of the operating system to implement higher-level constructs. </P>

<P>This documentation describes the kernel improvements for Windows&nbsp;XP and later versions, which include:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="enhancements5_89df.htm"><B>Registry Enhancements</B></A>
<P>Larger registries, limited only by available system disk space. Improved algorithms for faster queries.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="enhancements5_5ppv.htm"><B>Support_Enhancements</B></A>
<P>Cross-session debugging, new quit and detach command for debugging without killing the application, and built-in user mode heap-leak detection.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="enhancements5_33oz.htm"><B>I/O Subsystem Enhancements</B></A>
<P>New input/output (I/O) interfaces for performance enhancement, while retaining compatibility with Windows&nbsp;2000 drivers. Kernel-mode support routines for File System Filter driver improvements. Support for performance measurements in retail code, and improved low-memory performance.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="enhancements5_3oc3.htm"><B>Memory Management Enhancements</B></A>
<P>Broad range of improvements, including logical prefetch to improve boot and logon performance, reduced paged pool usage, enhanced terminal server support, support of giant drivers, and Windows&nbsp;XP execution from ROM. 
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="enhancements5_4bg3.htm"><B>Power ManagementEnhancements</B></A>
<P>Native support for processor performance control, including Intel SpeedStep Technology, AMD PowerNow!, and Transmeta LongRun for longer mobile computer battery life. Hibernate, standby, and resume performance have been greatly improved.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="enhancements5_0qhx.htm"><B>Improved Boot and Logon Performance</B></A>
<P>When a Windows&nbsp;XP system is first booted, data is saved about all logical disk read operations. On later boots, this information is used to prefetch these files in parallel with other boot operations.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="enhancements5_3984.htm"><B>Headless Support</B></A>
<P>For "lights-out" datacenter deployment and remote administration.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="enhancements5_3a7o.htm"><B>ccNUMA Support for Windows Server 2003</B></A>
<P>Provides better performance for Cache CoherentNon Uniform Memory Access (ccNUMA) computers, as well as an interface to let applications tailor their execution characteristics in the ccNUMA environment.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>The Windows&nbsp;XP kernel improvements provide new opportunities for independent software vendors (ISV), independent hardware vendors (IHV), and other value-added providers working with Windows&nbsp;2000. Windows&nbsp;XP provides compatibility with Windows&nbsp;2000 devices and drivers, while providing new routines, enhancements, and other features that can be leveraged into future products and services.</P>
