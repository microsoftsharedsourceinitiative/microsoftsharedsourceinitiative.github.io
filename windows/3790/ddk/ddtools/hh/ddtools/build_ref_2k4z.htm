<P>The NOLINK and <A HREF="build_ref_93lf.htm">MAKEDLL</A> macros are primarily used in the master make file (<A HREF="build_ref_9oc3.htm"><I>makefile.def</I></A>) to indicate which rules to enable or disable when the Build utility goes through two tools.</P>

<P>NOLINK=1 indicates that a link is not supposed to occur — most likely because this is pass one and the Build utility cannot guarantee that the libraries needed are built yet.</P>

<P>MAKEDLL=1 indicates that a link should occur and is used in pass two after the libraries are built. If you run a one-pass build (by specifying <B>-z</B> on the command line to the Build utility), only MAKEDLL=1 is specified.</P>

<P>You can test for this macro in your make file. For example, if NOLINK=1,  you are in pass one; if MAKEDLL=1, you are in pass two.</P>
