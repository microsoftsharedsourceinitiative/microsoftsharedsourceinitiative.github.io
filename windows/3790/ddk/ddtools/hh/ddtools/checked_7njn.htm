<P>Instead of installing the complete checked build on your computer, you can install the free build of the system, and then install the checked versions of just the operating system image and HAL. If you use this procedure, you can configure the boot loader to provide you with two boot options. One boot option is for the free build. The second boot option starts the system using just the checked operating system image and HAL, but uses free versions of all other system components.</P>

<P>This approach, compared to installing the complete checked build, provides the following advantages: 

<UL>
	<LI>Drivers get the benefit of the operating-system and HAL debug checks. At the same time, because free versions of system components other than the operating system and HAL are being used, the performance impact on the entire system is minimized. </LI>

	<LI>A single installation (and thus one system directory, one set of executable components, and one set of registry parameters) can use either the checked or the free version of the operating system image and HAL, as determined at boot time.</LI>
</UL>

<P>To install the checked versions of the operating system image and HAL, you must copy the appropriate files from the checked distribution medium to the <I>%SystemRoot%\system32</I> directory using new, unique file names. Then you must instruct the system to offer an option that uses these files during system startup. There are a few important guidelines to keep in mind when installing checked operating system and HAL images on an otherwise free installation:

<UL>
	<LI>The operating system image and HAL must be kept in synch at all times. Therefore, if you use a checked version of the operating system image, you must also use the checked version of the HAL (and vice versa). Failure to keep a system's operating system image and HAL coordinated can make the system unbootable.</LI>

	<LI>Do not overwrite the free versions of the operating system image and the HAL that are installed during the installation of the free build. Overwriting the free versions of the operating system image and HAL can make the system unbootable, and can make it difficult to recover from errors. Therefore, always be careful to use new, unique file names when copying the checked versions of the operating system and HAL to the <I>%SystemRoot%\system32</I> directory.</LI>

	<LI>Make sure the checked distribution you use is the same Service Pack number as that of the free system. For example, if you are installing the checked operating system image and HAL onto a system for which Service Pack 2 of a free build system is installed, make certain that the checked distribution you are using is also Service Pack 2.</LI>
</UL>

<P>If you follow these guidelines, installing the checked versions of the operating system and HAL is easy.</P>

<P>Use the following steps to install a partial checked build.</P>

<H4>Step 1: Identifying the Files To Install</H4>

<P>Your first step in installing a partial checked build is to determine the version of the operating system image and HAL files that were used to install the free build on your system.</P>

<P>Several different versions of the operating system and HAL images are supplied on the NT-based operating system distribution medium. These different versions exist to support different combinations of processors and other system hardware. When the operating system software is installed, the installation procedure automatically identifies which operating system image and HAL image to use, and copies the appropriate files from the distribution medium to the system's <I>%SystemRoot%\system32</I> directory.</P>

<P>The operating system image file that is installed depends on whether one or multiple processors are to be supported, and on whether Physical Address Extension (PAE) is supported. (PAE is active on systems with more than 4 GB of physical memory.). The file names on the distribution medium are as follows:

<DL>
<DT><I>ntoskrnl.exe</I></DT>

<DD>Uniprocessor x86 architecture systems with 4 GB of physical memory or less.</DD>

<DT><I>ntkrnlpa.exe</I></DT>

<DD>Uniprocessor x86 architecture systems with PAE support.</DD>

<DT><I>ntkrnlmp.exe</I></DT>

<DD>Multiprocessor x86 architecture systems with 4 GB of physical memory or less.</DD>

<DT><I>ntkrpamp.exe</I></DT>

<DD>Multiprocessor x86 architecture systems with PAE support.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>Likewise, there are several different names for the HAL.</P>

<P>During system installation, the installation procedure determines the appropriate operating system image and HAL to install on your system. The selected files are copied to the <I>%SystemRoot%\system32</I> directory during installation, using fixed, well-known, names. The use of these fixed names makes it easy for the loader to locate these files at boot time. The fixed names for these files are:

<DL>
<DT><I>ntoskrnl.exe</I></DT>

<DD>Operating system image for x86 systems with 4 GB or less of physical memory.</DD>

<DT><I>ntkrnlpa.exe</I></DT>

<DD>Operating system image for x86 systems with more than 4 GB of physical memory.</DD>

<DT><I>hal.dll</I></DT>

<DD>Loadable HAL image.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>Note that in some cases, depending on the system’s hardware configuration, one or more of the files may be <I>renamed to the appropriate fixed name</I>. In other cases, the file name on the distribution medium is the same as the required fixed file name.</P>

<P>Your first step in installing the checked operating system image and HAL is to determine the original names of the images that were copied to your system during system installation. You do this by examining the file <I>%SystemRoot%\repair\setup.log</I>. This is a hidden file, so you will have to change its attributes before it can be displayed by the MS-DOS® <B>dir</B> command.</P>

<P>The <I>setup.log</I> file indicates the files that were copied from the distribution medium to the <I>%SystemRoot%\system32</I> directory during the system installation process. Here is an example of a <I>setup.log</I> file:</P>

<PRE>[Paths]
TargetDirectory = "\WINNT"
TargetDevice = "\Device\Harddisk0\Partition1"
SystemPartitionDirectory = "\"
SystemPartition = "\Device\Harddisk0\Partition1"
[Signature]
Version = "WinNt5.1"
[Files.SystemPartition]
NTDETECT.COM = "NTDETECT.COM","f41f"
ntldr = "ntldr","3e8b5"
arcsetup.exe = "arcsetup.exe","379db"
arcldr.exe = "arcldr.exe","2eca9"
[Files.WinNt]
\WINNT\system32\drivers\kbdclass.sys = "kbdclass.sys","e259"
\WINNT\system32\drivers\mouclass.sys = "mouclass.sys","7e78"
\WINNT\system32\drivers\uhcd.sys = "uhcd.sys","10217"
\WINNT\system32\drivers\usbd.sys = "usbd.sys","5465"
(…several similar lines omitted…)
\WINNT\system32\framebuf.dll = "framebuf.dll","10c84"
\WINNT\system32\hal.dll = "halmacpi.dll","2bedf"
\WINNT\system32\ntkrnlpa.exe = "ntkrpamp.exe","1d66a6"
\WINNT\system32\ntoskrnl.exe = "ntkrnlmp.exe","1ce5c5"
\WINNT\inf\mdmrpci.inf = "mdmrpci.inf","96a3"
</PRE>

<P>You can identify which operating system image and HAL files were installed on your system by searching <I>setup.log</I> for the fixed operating system image file names. Make a note of the original file names used on your system, because you will need to copy the checked versions of these same files from the checked distribution kit. You will find the standard, well-known, file name on the left of the equal sign. Its original name from the distribution medium will be immediately to the right of the equal sign on the same line.</P>

<P>In the sample <I>setup.log</I> file shown above, you can see that two operating system image files were copied to the <I>\winnt\system32</I> directory (which is <I>%SystemRoot%\system32</I>) during installation. The file <I>ntkrpamp.exe</I> is copied from the distribution medium to <I>ntkrnlpa.exe</I> and the file <I>ntkrnlmp.exe</I> is copied from the distribution medium to <I>ntoskrnl.exe</I>. From this sample, you can also see that the HAL file (with the fixed name <I>hal.dll</I> in the <I>%SystemRoot%\system32</I> directory) was originally named <I>halmacpi.dll</I>.</P>

<P class=note><B>Warning</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some HAL files have deceptively similar names. For example, <I>halacpi.dll</I> and <I>halapic.dll</I> are two commonly used HALs. Be careful to use the correct version of the HAL for your system. Selecting the wrong HAL will result in a system that is not bootable.</P>

<H4>Step 2: Copying the Checked Files</H4>

<P>Now that you know the names of the files that were used during your system installation, you can copy the checked versions of these files to your system. Find the files you have identified in the checked distribution kit. Then copy these files to the <I>%SystemRoot%\system32</I> directory of your system, giving them new, unique, file names. The copies of these files must follow the 8.3 naming convention. One way to ensure unique, 8.3-compliant file names is to rename the file types from their original file types (<I>.dll</I> or <I>.exe</I>) to <I>.chk</I> when they are copied. Thus, using the example started in Step 1, you would copy files from the checked distribution kit as follows:</P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=50%>If the original file name in the checked distribution is: </TH>
<TH align=left width=50%>Copy it to the following file name in <I>%SystemRoot%\system32</I>: </TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=50%><I>ntkrnlmp.exe</I></TD>
<TD width=50%><I>ntkrnlmp.chk</I></TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=50%><I>ntkrpamp.exe</I></TD>
<TD width=50%><I>ntkrpamp.chk</I></TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=50%><I>halmapic.dll</I></TD>
<TD width=50%><I>halmapic.chk</I></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>Some files in the checked distribution are provided in compressed form. These files are indicated with an underscore character as the last character in their file type. For example, if you look for the file <I>halapic.dll</I> in the checked build distribution kit, but you find the file <I>halapic.dl_</I>, you have found the correct file, but in compressed form.</P>

<P>To decompress compressed files from the checked distribution, use the Expand utility (<I>%SystemRoot%\system32\expand.exe</I>). For example, to expand <I>halapic.dl_</I> and name the expanded file <I>halapic.chk</I>, you can use the following command from an MS-DOS Command Prompt window:</P>

<PRE>&gt; <B>expand halapic.dl_ halapic.chk</B></PRE>

<H4>Step 3: Editing <I>boot.ini</I></H4>

<P>After you have copied the checked files to the <I>%SystemRoot%\system32</I> directory, you must create a boot-time option that allows the system to be started using these checked files. You do this by editing the file <I>boot.ini</I>.</P>

<P>For general instructions, see <A HREF="bootini_4elv.htm">Editing the <I>boot.ini</I> File</A>.</P>

<P>In this specific case, you need to create a new boot-time option that allows you to start the system with the checked version of the operating system image and HAL that you have installed.</P>

<P>Locate the line in the <B>[operating systems]</B> section of <I>boot.ini</I> that refers to your Windows installation. Make a second copy of it, and add to the end of the copied line the following parameters:</P>

<PRE><B>/kernel=</B><I>KernelFile</I><B> /hal=</B><I>HalFile</I> 
</PRE>

<P>where <I>KernelFile</I> is the name of the checked version of the operating system image file that you previously copied from the checked distribution kit, and <I>HalFile </I>is the name of the checked version of the HAL that you previously copied from the checked distribution kit.</P>

<P>If the line that describes your operating system contains the <B>/PAE</B> parameter, be sure to use the checked version of the operating system image that supports Physical Address Extension. If the line that describes your operating system does not have the <B>/PAE</B> parameter, use the checked version of the operating system image without PAE support.</P>

<P>You should also change the quoted text on the new line, so that you will be able to identify which line is the free build and which line is the partial checked build.</P>

<P>Here is an example of such a <I>boot.ini</I> file:</P>

<PRE>[boot loader]
timeout=30
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT
[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT="Microsoft Windows&nbsp;2000 Professional" /fastdetect
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT="Windows&nbsp;2000 Checked" /fastdetect /kernel=ntoskrnl.chk /hal=halacpi.chk
</PRE>

<P>If you will be using the checked build with a kernel debugger, you should also add the proper debugging-related parameters. (The<B> /kernel</B> and <B>/hal</B> parameters do not enable debugging automatically.) See <A HREF="bootini_4elv.htm">Editing the <I>boot.ini</I> File</A> for details.</P>

<P>Once you have made your changes, save the changes and exit from the editor. The next time you boot this system, a new operating system boot option will be displayed that allows you to select your checked operating system image and HAL.</P>

<H4>Installing Additional Checked Files</H4>

<P>Once you have the checked operating system and HAL installed, you have the option to install additional checked components. You can replace the installed, free versions of a few key components with their checked counterparts from the checked distribution medium. This can be helpful, for example, when you are writing a driver that exists within a stack of other devices. By replacing the free versions of the drivers that are above and below your driver in the stack, you will enable additional error checking in these components. This could help you identify problems in your driver more quickly and easily.</P>

<P>When replacing free drivers with their checked counterparts, there is no way to easily provide alternate images for system-supplied driver components. Thus, when you replace free drivers with checked drivers on your system, the checked drivers will be used when either the free or checked version of the operating system image and HAL is started. Therefore, you might want to rename (or copy) the original free versions of any drivers that you replace with their checked counterparts, so that you can restore the free drivers later.</P>

<P>Finally, note that any time you change one of the standard files that exist in one of the system directories (such as <I>%SystemRoot%\system32</I>) Windows File Protection (WFP) will restore that file to its original state unless WFP is first disabled. If a debugger is attached to your system, you can temporarily disable Windows File Protection by changing the following registry value:</P>

<PRE>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
SFCDisable:REG_DWORD:2
</PRE>

<P>Setting <B>SFCDisable</B> to a value of <B>2</B> disables WFP for the next boot (only). A value of <B>0</B> (the default) enables WFP. For a description of the features of WFP, see the Platform SDK. For more information on the WFP registry settings, see <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=3100&ID=222473&clcid=0x409" TARGET="_blank">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article Q222473</A>.</P>
