<P>Reading the results of a test can be rather cryptic sometimes. </P>

<P>The test will fail if:

<UL>
	<LI>The machine bug checks. This is the most common form of failure. For more information, see <A HREF="bcintro_3dkj.htm">Bug Check Codes</A>.</LI>

	<LI>The device's children failed to re-appear after a stop/start operation (that is, you are testing a USB HUB, and before the test there was a USB mouse plugged into the hub, and afterward, Device Manager cannot find the mouse).</LI>

	<LI>The device or one of its children failed to restart properly. In this situation, the Device Manager shows an error code. Error codes are enumerated in <I>Cfg.h</I>.</LI>

	<LI>There is a change in the status code of the device or one of its children — that is, if DN_LIAR gets set after a start/stop operation. Status codes are enumerated in <I>Cfg.h</I>.</LI>

	<LI>The device cannot be disabled. Sometimes this is normal if the device is in use, so make sure no one's using that device while it's being tested.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch for memory leaks. Drivers can allocate memory, and not freeing memory on shutdown can cause a machine to leak a lot of memory in a very short time. Try using Poolmon for detection of memory leaks.</P>
