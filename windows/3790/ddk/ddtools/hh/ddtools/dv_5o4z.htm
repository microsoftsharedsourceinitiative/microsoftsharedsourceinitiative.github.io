<P>Windows kernel-mode graphics drivers do not allocate pool directly. Instead, these drivers use Graphics Driver Interface (GDI) service routines exported by <I>win32k.sys</I>.</P>

<P>Because of this difference, Driver Verifier treats graphics drivers differently than it treats other kernel-mode drivers.</P>

<P>The following sections describe Driver Verifier's actions on display drivers and kernel-mode printer drivers.

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="dv_2d4j.htm"><B>Special Memory Pool for Graphics Drivers</B></A> 
<P>When this option is active, Driver Verifier allocates most of the driver's memory requests from a special pool. This special pool is monitored for memory overruns, memory underruns, and memory that is accessed after it is freed.
</LI>

	<LI><A HREF="dv_2r8z.htm"><B>Low Resources Simulation for Graphics Drivers</B></A> 
<P>When this option is active, Driver Verifier randomly fails memory requests and other resource requests. By injecting these allocation faults into the system, Driver Verifier tests the driver's ability to cope with a low-resource situation.
</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Inapplicable Options for Graphics Drivers</H4>

<P>The Automatic Checks, Forcing IRQL Checking, Memory Pool Tracking, I/O Verification, DMA Verification, Deadlock Detection, and SCSI Verification options are not used for graphics drivers. If selected, these options have no effect.</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Driver Verifier can be set to verify <I>win32k.sys</I> itself. However, this has the effect of verifying all graphics drivers simultaneously. To obtain more specific information about a graphics driver, Driver Verifier should be set to verify only the driver under investigation.</P>
