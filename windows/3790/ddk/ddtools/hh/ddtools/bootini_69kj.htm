<H2><A NAME="ddk_adding_boot_entries_tools"></A>Adding Boot Entries</H2>

<P>The first step in customizing boot options is to add a new boot entry for an operating system. A <I>boot entry</I> is a set of options that define a load configuration for an operating system or bootable program.</P>

<P>You can have multiple boot entries for an operating system, each with a different set of boot parameters. The Windows Installer creates a standard boot entry when you install an operating system and you can create additional, customized boot entries for an operating system by editing the boot options in NVRAM.</P>

<P>You can add, delete, and change the options in the boot entry that the Windows Installer created. However, it is prudent to keep the standard entry and, instead, add a separate entry that you customize.</P>

<P>To add a boot entry, copy an existing boot entry and modify the copy.</P>

<H4>Using Bootcfg</H4>

<P>You can use the Bootcfg <B>/copy</B> switch to copy a boot entry on an x86-based or Itanium-based system. </P>

<P>The following Bootcfg command copies the second boot entry to create a new entry. The <B>/ID</B> switch identifies the line number of the entry being copied and the <B>/d</B> (description) switch specifies a friendly name for the new entry, which must be in quotation marks.</P>

<PRE><B>bootcfg /copy /ID 2 /d "Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP Professional - new"
</B></PRE>

<P>If you have added boot entries that you are no longer using, be sure to delete them, especially on computers that store boot options in the finite NVRAM resource. Use the Bootcfg&nbsp;<B>/delete</B> switch to delete unused entries.</P>

<P>If you have more than one boot entry for an operating system, be sure to select your preferred entry from the boot menu or set the preferred entry as the default boot entry. For instructions, see <A HREF="bootini_5qer.htm">Changing the Default Boot Entry</A>.</P>

<P>For complete instructions for using Bootcfg, see Help and Support Services. For examples, see <A HREF="bootini_1gj7.htm">Using Boot Parameters</A>.</P>

<H4>Editing the <I>boot.ini</I> file</H4>

<P>To add a boot entry to a <I>boot.ini</I> file on an x86-based computer, copy and paste an existing boot entry. Then change the friendly name of the entry so you can easily distinguish it in the file and in the boot menu. The friendly name is the quoted string in the boot entry.</P>

<P>For example, in the following sample <I>boot.ini</I> file, the original entry for Windows&nbsp;XP was duplicated, and then the friendly name of the duplicate entry was changed. The newly created entry appears in bold text.</P>
