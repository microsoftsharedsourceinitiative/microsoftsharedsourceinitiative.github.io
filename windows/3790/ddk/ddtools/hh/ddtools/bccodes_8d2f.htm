<H1><A NAME="ddk_bug_check_0x96_bug"></A>Bug Check 0x96: INVALID_WORK_QUEUE_ITEM</H1>

<P>The INVALID_WORK_QUEUE_ITEM bug check has a value of 0x00000096. This indicates that a queue entry was removed that contained a null pointer.</P>

<H4>Parameters</H4>

<P>The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=21%>Parameter</TH>
<TH align=left width=79%>Description</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>1</TD>
<TD width=79%>The address of the queue entry whose <B>flink</B> or <B>blink</B> field is NULL </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>2</TD>
<TD width=79%>The address of the queue being referenced. Usually this is an <B>ExWorkerQueue</B>. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>3</TD>
<TD width=79%>The base address of the <B>ExWorkerQueue</B> array. (This will help determine if the queue in question is indeed an <B>ExWorkerQueue</B>. If it is, the offset from this parameter will isolate the queue.)</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>4</TD>
<TD width=79%>Assuming the queue is an <B>ExWorkerQueue</B>, this is the address of the worker routine that would have been called if the work item had been valid. (This can be used to isolate the driver that is misusing the work queue.) </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<H4>Cause</H4>

<P>This error occurs when <B>KeRemoveQueue</B> removes a queue entry whose <B>flink</B> or <B>blink</B> field is NULL.</P>

<P>Any queue misuse can cause this, but most commonly this results from the misuse of worker thread work items.</P>

<P>The rule is that an entry on a queue may only be inserted on the list once. When an item is removed from a queue, its <B>flink</B> field is set to NULL. Then the second time this item is removed, this bug check occurs.</P>

<P>In most cases, the queue being referenced is an <B>ExWorkerQueue</B> (executive worker queue). To help identify the driver that caused the error, the address of the worker routine that would have been called if this work item had been valid is displayed as Parameter&nbsp;4. However, if the queue being referenced is <I>not</I> an <B>ExWorkerQueue</B>, then this parameter will not be useful.</P>
