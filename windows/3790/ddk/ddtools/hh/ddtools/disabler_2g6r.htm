<P>The core of the program revolves around a CM_DisableDevNode() and CM_Enable_DevNode() loop. The test first looks for all the devices it can test. Certain classes of devices are not testable in this fashion; for example, devices whose classes are SYSTEM will not be tested. Excluded classes include SYSTEM, VOLUME, LEGACYDRIVER, DISPLAY, MONITOR, CDROM, FDC, and FLOPPYDISK.</P>

<P>The core algorithm of the test is as follows.

<UL>
	<LI>Get information on the device being tested (status and problem code, and so on). </LI>

	<LI>Get information about the device's children (again, status and problem code, and so on). </LI>

	<LI>Disable that device, or remove this device. </LI>

	<LI>Wait (this delay time is settable). </LI>

	<LI>Enable this device or refresh its parent. </LI>

	<LI>Wait (allow for the device's children to re-enumerate and restart). </LI>

	<LI>Check that all the children came back and are working by checking the problem code, status code, and so on. </LI>

	<LI>Check that the device node came back and is working by checking the problem code, status code, and so on. </LI>

	<LI>(Optional) Launch a child test and record its log file (see the following Usage section). </LI>

	<LI>Repeat (the number of repetitions is programmable; see the following Usage section). </LI>
</UL>
