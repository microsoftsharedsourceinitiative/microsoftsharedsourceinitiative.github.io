<P>The <B>INF File Creation Wizard</B>, or GenINF, is a GUI-based tool that guides the user through the process of creating Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;2000 and Windows&nbsp;XP device driver INF files. Please note the Limitations section. GenINF does not generate fully valid INF files. However, the skeleton INF files it generates should help developers complete their device driver INF files.</P>

<P>GenINF supports all device classes, but includes specific support for only certain device classes. For a list of these classes, see the <I>geninf.htm</I> file that is located in the <I>Tools\geninf</I> subdirectory of the DDK.</P>

<P>The tool has not been extensively tested. Carefully review all INF files created by GenINF. </P>

<H2>Running the Tool</H2>

<P>GenINF is located in the <I>\Tools</I> subdirectory of the DDK installation directory. Because it is GUI-based, it can be executed from within the Windows®&nbsp;2000 User Interface, or from the command prompt. GenINF takes no arguments. </P>

<H2>Limitations</H2>

<P>GenINF supports the creation of INF files for Windows®&nbsp;2000 only. It does not create INF files for Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT 4.0. </P>

<P>GenINF creates single architecture INF files only. Multi-architecture INF files are not supported. </P>

<P>GenINF does not always create complete and fully functional INF files. Users should review all INF files created by GenINF, and modify as required. Users should expect to add additional INF directives, especially any directives that are device-class-specific or that contain device-class-specific information. </P>
