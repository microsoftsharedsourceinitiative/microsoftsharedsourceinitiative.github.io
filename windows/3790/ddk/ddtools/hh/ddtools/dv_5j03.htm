<P>When Low Resources Simulation is enabled, Driver Verifier will cause a random selection of the driver's memory allocations to fail. This tests the driver's ability to react properly to low-memory and other low-resource conditions.</P>

<P>To accurately simulate a low-memory condition, these allocation faults are not injected until seven minutes after system startup. Therefore, any driver errors that are exposed by this action should be treated as legitimate run-time problems, not as unrealistic scenarios.</P>

<P>Driver Verifier can verify selected drivers or all drivers at the same time.  </P>

<H4>Monitoring the Low Resources Simulation</H4>

<P>The number of times Driver Verifier deliberately fails resource allocations can be monitored. This statistic can be displayed by the Driver Verifier Manager graphical interface, the <I>verifier.exe</I> command line, or in a log file. See <A HREF="dv_9ib7.htm">Monitoring Global Counters</A> for details.</P>

<P>The kernel debugger extension <B>!verifier</B> can also be used to monitor this statistic. It presents similar information to that of Driver Verifier Manager. In Windows XP and later, the <B>!verifier&nbsp;0x4</B> extension will display a log of faults injected by Driver Verifier. For information about debugger extensions, see <A HREF="dbgblurb_25bn.htm">Debugging Tools for NT-Based Operating Systems</A>.</P>

<H4>Activating This Option</H4>

<P>The Low Resources Simulation option can be activated by using the Driver Verifier Manager graphical interface or the <I>verifier.exe</I> command line. This activation will take effect after the next boot. See <A HREF="dv_5q43.htm">Selecting Driver Verifier Options</A> for details.</P>

<P>This option can also be turned on and off without an intervening reboot. See <A HREF="dv_0a9f.htm">Using Volatile Settings</A> for details.</P>

<H4>Graphics Drivers</H4>

<P>See <A HREF="dv_2r8z.htm">Low Resources Simulation for Graphics Drivers</A> for details on how this option affects display drivers and kernel-mode printer drivers.</P>
