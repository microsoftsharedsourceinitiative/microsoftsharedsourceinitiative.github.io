<H1><A NAME="ddk_bug_check_0xc000021a_bug"></A>Bug Check 0xC000021A: STATUS_SYSTEM_PROCESS_TERMINATED</H1>

<P>The STATUS_SYSTEM_PROCESS_TERMINATED bug check has a value of 0xC000021A. This means that an error has occurred in a crucial user-mode subsystem.</P>

<H4>Parameters</H4>

<P>This bug check will display a descriptive text message.</P>

<H4>Cause</H4>

<P>This error occurs when a user-mode subsystem, such as WinLogon or the Client Server Runtime Subsystem (CSRSS), has been fatally compromised and security can no longer be guaranteed. In response, the operating system switches to kernel mode. Microsoft Windows cannot run without WinLogon or CSRSS. Therefore, this is one of the few cases where the failure of a user-mode service can shut down the system.</P>

<P>Mismatched system files can also cause this error. This can occur if you have restored your hard disk from a backup. Some backup programs might skip restoring system files that they determine are in use.</P>

<H4>Resolving the Problem</H4>

<P>Running the kernel debugger is not useful in this situation because the actual error occurred in a user-mode process.</P>

<P><I>Resolving an error in a user-mode device driver, system service, or third-party application:</I> <I> </I>Because bug check 0xC000021A occurs in a user-mode process, the most common culprits are third-party applications. If the error occurred after the installation of a new or updated device driver, system service, or third-party application, the new software should be removed or disabled. Contact the manufacturer of the software about a possible update. </P>

<P>If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting Windows <B>Advanced Options</B> menu, choose the <B>Last Known Good Configuration</B> option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time. If this does not resolve the error, try manually removing the offending software. If the system partition is formatted with file allocation table (FAT), use an MS-DOS startup disk to gain access to the computer’s hard disk. If the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty software. If the faulty software is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer using the Recovery Console in order to access the file. If a newly installed piece if hardware is suspected, remove it to see if this resolves the issue.</P>

<P>Try running the Emergency Recovery Disk (ERD) and allow the system to repair any errors that it detects.  </P>

<P><I>Resolving a mismatched system file problem:</I> If you have recently restored your hard disk from a backup, check if there is an updated version of the Backup/Restore program available from the manufacturer. Make sure the latest Windows Service Pack is installed.</P>
