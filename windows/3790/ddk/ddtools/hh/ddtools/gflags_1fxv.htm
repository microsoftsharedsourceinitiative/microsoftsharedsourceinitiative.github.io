<P>GFlags (<I>gflags.exe</I>), the Global Flag Editor, enables and disables advanced internal system diagnostic and troubleshooting features. You can run GFlags from a Command Prompt window or use its graphical user interface dialog box.</P>

<P>Use GFlags to activate the following features:

<DL>
<DT>Registry</DT>

<DD>Set system-wide debugging features for all processes running on the computer. These settings are stored the <B>GlobalFlag</B> registry entry (<B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ SYSTEM\ CurrentControlSet</B>\ <B>Control\ Session Manager\ GlobalFlag</B>). They take effect when you restart Windows and remain effective until you change them. </DD>

<DT>Kernel-mode settings</DT>

<DD>Set debugging features for this session. These settings are effective immediately, but are lost when Windows shuts down. The settings affect all processes started after this command completes. </DD>

<DT>Image file settings</DT>

<DD>Set debugging features for a particular program. These settings are stored in a GlobalFlag registry entry for each program (<B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ SOFTWARE\ Microsoft\ Windows&nbsp;NT\ CurrentVersion\ Image File Execution Options\ </B><I>ImageFileName</I><B>\ GlobalFlag</B>). They take effect when you restart the program and remain effective until you change them.</DD>

<DT>Debugger</DT>

<DD>Specify that a particular program always runs in a debugger. This setting is stored in the registry. It is effective immediately and remains effective until you change it. (This feature is available only in the <B>Global Flags</B> dialog box.) </DD>

<DT>Launch</DT>

<DD>Run a program with the specified debugging settings. The debugging settings are effective until the program stops. (This feature is available only from the <B>Global Flags</B> dialog box.) </DD>

<DT>Kernel Special Pool</DT>

<DD>Use a special memory pool for all allocations that have a specified pool tag or are within a specified size range. This feature helps you to detect and identify the source of errors in kernel pool use, such as writing beyond the allocated memory space, or referring to memory that has already been freed.</DD>

<DT>Page heap verification</DT>

<DD>Enable, disable, and configure page heap verification for a program. When enabled, page heap monitors dynamic heap memory operations, including allocation and free operations, and causes a debugger break when it detects a heap error. 


</DD>
