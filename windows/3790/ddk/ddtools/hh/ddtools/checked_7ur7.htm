<P>While the checked build and <A HREF="dv_7g8j.htm">Driver Verifier</A> provide some checks that overlap, it’s best to think of them as providing complementary levels of checking. Testing your driver with the checked build is not a substitute for testing with Driver Verifier. Similarly, testing with Driver Verifier does not provide precisely the same level of test coverage as using the checked build.</P>

<P>When Driver Verifier runs on the checked build, it often displays additional information in the debugger when a problem is detected. In addition, when a debugger is attached, in many cases Driver Verifier will execute a breakpoint prior to halting the system with a bug check. This break point gives you a chance to examine the state of the system, and debug your driver, prior to the Driver-Verifier-invoked system crash.</P>
