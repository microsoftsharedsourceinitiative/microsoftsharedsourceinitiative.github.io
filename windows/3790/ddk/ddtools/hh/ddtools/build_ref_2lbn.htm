<P>Use the INCLUDES macro to indicate the location of the headers to be included in your build. This macro should be invoked from within your <A HREF="build_ref_3egj.htm"><I>sources</I> file</A>.</P>

<P>This macro should be set to a list of the paths to be searched for include files during compilation. Separate the entries in this list using a semicolon. Path names can be absolute, or relative to the directory in which the <I>sources</I> file resides.</P>

<P>For example:</P>

<PRE>INCLUDES=bunny;inc
INCLUDES=.\
INCLUDES=.\inc
</PRE>

<P>The INCLUDES macro is read by the Build utility. It looks at the INCLUDES variable that you specify in your <I>sources</I> file to determine the location of the header files that you are including in your source code so that it can build the dependency tree.</P>

<P>Paths specified in the INCLUDES macro will be searched before the default paths. The list of default paths is determined by the values of <A HREF="build_ref_8ctv.htm">TARGETTYPE</A> and <A HREF="build_ref_3d2r.htm">DRIVERTYPE</A>. Depending on the values of these macros, the default paths can include the values of any of the following macros: <A HREF="build_ref_01v7.htm">CRT_INC_PATH</A>, <A HREF="build_ref_4d83.htm">DDK_INC_PATH</A>, <A HREF="build_ref_6b5f.htm">WDM_INC_PATH</A>, <A HREF="build_ref_04mr.htm">SDK_INC_PATH</A>, <A HREF="build_ref_9d6b.htm">OAK_INC_PATH</A>, or <A HREF="build_ref_2i9f.htm">MFC_INC_PATH</A>.</P>

<P>You will usually use the INCLUDES macro in your <I>sources</I> file to indicate to the Build utility the location of the headers to be included in your build. However, there are times when some header files may not exist (for example, if they are built as part of the build process). Such headers should be specified in the <A HREF="build_ref_42r7.htm">USER_INCLUDES</A> macro.</P>
